<HTML><BODY>In spite of its title, this <i>Short history of freethought</i> is a comprehensive overview of the history of freethought, critical thinking and opposition to dominant religious views. The two volumes together are over 1000 pages, and have countless footnotes in small type.

<p>Occasional greek, and a lot of foreign names, titles, etc., so enough to have a lot of fun!
