<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This, the third edition, represents a considerable
expansion of the second (1906), which in its turn was a considerable
expansion of the first (1899). The book now somewhat approximates, in
point of fullness, to the modest ideal aimed at. Anything much fuller
would cease to be a &ldquo;Short History.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The process of revision, carried on since the last issue, has, I
hope, meant some further advance towards correctness, and some
improvement in arrangement&mdash;a particularly difficult matter in
such a book. As before, the many critical <i>excursus</i> have been so
printed that they may be recognized and skipped by those readers who
care to follow only the narrative. The chapter on the nineteenth
century, though much expanded, like those on the eighteenth, remains, I
fear, open to objection on the score of scantiness. I can only plead
that the ample and excellent work of Mr. A. W. Benn has now
substantially met the need for a fuller survey of that period.</p>
<p>It is fitting that I should acknowledge the generous critical
reception given by most reviewers to the previous editions of a book
which, breaking as it did new ground, lacked the gain from previous
example that accrues to most historical writing. My many debts to
historians of culture are, I trust, indicated in the notes; but I have
to repeat my former acknowledgments as to the <i>Biographical
Dictionary of Freethinkers</i> of my dead friend, J. M. Wheeler,
inasmuch as the aid I have had from his manifold research does not thus
appear on the surface. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1131" href=
"#xd25e1131" name="xd25e1131">xii</a>]</span></p>
<p>It remains to add my thanks to a number of friendly correspondents
who have assisted me by pointing out shortcomings and errors. Further
assistance of the same kind will be gratefully welcomed. It is still my
hope that the book may help some more leisured student in the
construction of a more massive record of the development of rational
thought on the side of human life with which it deals.</p>
<p>An apology is perhaps due to the purchasers of the second edition,
which is now superseded by a fuller record. I can but plead that I have
been unable otherwise to serve their need; and express a hope that the
low price of the present edition will be a compensation.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The words &ldquo;freethinking&rdquo; and
&ldquo;freethinker&rdquo; first appear in English literature about the
end of the seventeenth century, and seem to have originated there and
then, as we do not find them earlier in French or in Italian,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1160src" href="#xd25e1160" name="xd25e1160src">1</a>
the only other modern literatures wherein the phenomena for which the
words stand had previously arisen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The title of &ldquo;atheist&rdquo; had been from time
immemorial applied to every shade of serious heresy by the orthodox, as
when the early Christians were so described by the image-adoring
polytheists around them; and in Latin Christendom the term <i lang=
"la">infidelis</i>, translating the <span class="trans" title=
"apistos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7936;&pi;&#8055;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span> of
the New Testament, which primarily applied to Jews and pagans,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1192src" href="#xd25e1192" name="xd25e1192src">2</a>
was easily extensible, as in the writings of Augustine, to all who
challenged or doubted articles of ordinary Christian belief, all alike
being regarded as consigned to perdition.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1233src" href="#xd25e1233" name="xd25e1233src">3</a> It is by
this line of descent that the term &ldquo;infidelity,&rdquo; applied to
doubt on such doctrines as that of the future state, comes up in
England in the fifteenth century.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1245src"
href="#xd25e1245" name="xd25e1245src">4</a> It implied no systematic or
critical thinking. The label of &ldquo;deist,&rdquo; presumably
self-applied by the bearers, begins to come into use in French about
the middle of the sixteenth century;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1254src" href="#xd25e1254" name="xd25e1254src">5</a> and that of
&ldquo;naturalist,&rdquo; also presumably chosen by those who bore it,
came into currency about the same time. Lechler traces the latter term
in the Latin form as far back as the MS. of the <i>Heptaplomeres</i> of
Bodin, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>dated 1588; but it was common before that date, as
De Mornay in the preface to his <i lang="fr">De la V&eacute;rit&eacute;
de la religion chr&eacute;tienne</i> (1581) declaims &ldquo;against the
false naturalists (that is to say, professors of the knowledge of
nature and natural things)&rdquo;; and Montaigne in one of his later
essays (1588) has the phrase &ldquo;<i lang="fr">nous autres
naturalistes</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1277src" href=
"#xd25e1277" name="xd25e1277src">6</a> Apart from these terms, those
commonly used in French in the seventeenth century were <i lang=
"fr">bel esprit</i> (sometimes, though not necessarily, connoting
unbelief), <i lang="fr">esprit fort</i> and <i lang="fr">libertin</i>,
the latter being used in the sense of a religious doubter by Corneille,
Moli&egrave;re, and Bayle.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1292src" href=
"#xd25e1292" name="xd25e1292src">7</a></p>
<p>It seems to have first come into use as one of the hostile names for
the &ldquo;Brethren of the Free Spirit,&rdquo; a pantheistic and
generally heretical sect which became prominent in the thirteenth
century, and flourished widely, despite destructive persecution, till
the fifteenth. Their doctrine being antinomian, and their practice
often extravagant, they were accused by Churchmen of licentiousness, so
that in their case the name <i>Libertini</i> had its full latitude of
application. In the sixteenth century the name of Libertines is found
borne, voluntarily or otherwise, by a similar sect, probably springing
from some remnant of the first, but calling themselves <i lang=
"la">Spirituales</i>, who came into notice in Flanders, were favoured
in France by Marguerite of Navarre, sister of Francis I, and became to
some extent associated with sections of the Reformed Church. They were
attacked by Calvin in the treatise <i lang="fr">Contre la sects
fanatique et furieuse des Libertins</i> (1544 and 1545).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1315src" href="#xd25e1315" name="xd25e1315src">8</a>
The name of <i>Libertini</i> was not in the sixteenth century applied
by any Genevese writer to any political party;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1334src" href="#xd25e1334" name="xd25e1334src">9</a> but by later
historians it was in time either fastened on or adopted by the main
body of Calvin&rsquo;s opponents in Geneva, who probably included some
members of the sect or movement in question. They were accused by him
of general depravity, a judgment not at all to be acquiesced in, in
view of the controversial habits of the age; though they probably
included antinomian Christians and libertines in the modern sense, as
well as orthodox lovers of freedom and orderly non-Christians. As the
first Brethren of the Free Spirit, so-called, seem to have appeared in
Italy (where they are supposed to have derived, like the Waldenses,
from the immigrant Paulicians of the Eastern Church), the name
<i>Libertini</i> presumably originated there. But in Renaissance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>Italy an unbeliever seems usually to have been
called simply <i lang="it">ateo</i>, or <i lang="it">infedele</i>, or
<i lang="it">pagano</i>. &ldquo;The standing phrase was <i lang=
"it">non aver fede</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1358src"
href="#xd25e1358" name="xd25e1358src">10</a></p>
<p>In England, before and at the Reformation, both
&ldquo;infidel&rdquo; and &ldquo;faithless&rdquo; usually had the
theological force of &ldquo;non-Christian.&rdquo; Thus Tyndale says of
the Turks that though they &ldquo;knowledge one God,&rdquo; yet they
&ldquo;have erred and been <i>faithless</i> these eight hundred
years&rdquo;; adding the same of the Jews.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1372src" href="#xd25e1372" name="xd25e1372src">11</a> Throughout
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, &ldquo;infidel&rdquo; seems thus to have
commonly signified only a &ldquo;heathen&rdquo; or Jew or Mohammedan.
Bishop Jewel, for instance, writes that the Anglo-Saxon invaders of
Britain &ldquo;then were infidels&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1377src" href="#xd25e1377" name="xd25e1377src">12</a> and the
word appears to be normally used in that sense, or with a playful force
derived from that, by the divines, poets, and dramatists, including
Shakespeare, as by Milton in his verse.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1385src" href="#xd25e1385" name="xd25e1385src">13</a> Ben Jonson
has the phrase:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd25e1394">I did not expect</p>
<p class="line">To meet an infidel, much less an atheist,</p>

by early Elizabethans.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1414src" href=

&ldquo;Jews, Turks, or infidels&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=

writing in 1547, speaks, like Jewel, of the heathen as &ldquo;the
infidels.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1428src" href="#xd25e1428"
name="xd25e1428src">18</a> Hooker (1553&ndash;1600), in his Fifth
Sermon, &sect; 9,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1433src" href="#xd25e1433"
name="xd25e1433src">19</a> uses the word somewhat indefinitely, but in
his margin makes &ldquo;Pagans and Infidels&rdquo; equivalent to
&ldquo;Pagans and Turks.&rdquo; So also, in the <i>Ecclesiastical
Polity</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1442src" href="#xd25e1442" name=
"xd25e1442src">20</a> &ldquo;infidels&rdquo; means men of another
religion. On the title-page of Reginald Scot&rsquo;s <i>Discoverie of
Witchcraft</i> (1574), on the other hand, we have &ldquo;the
infidelitie of atheists&rdquo;; but so late as 1600 we find &ldquo;J.
H.&rdquo; [John Healy], the translator of Augustine&rsquo;s <i>City of
God</i>, rendering <i lang="la">infideles</i> and <i lang="la">homines
infideles</i> by &ldquo;unbelievers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1461src" href="#xd25e1461" name="xd25e1461src">21</a>
&ldquo;Infidelity,&rdquo; in the modern sense, occurs in Sir T.
Browne.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1472src" href="#xd25e1472" name=

</blockquote>
<p>In England, as in the rest of Europe, however, the phenomenon of
freethought had existed, in specific form, long before it could express
itself in propagandist writings, or find any generic name save those of
atheism and infidelity; and the process of naming was as fortuitous as
it generally is in matters of intellectual evolution. Phrases
approximating to &ldquo;free thought&rdquo; occur soon after the
Restoration. Thus Glanvill repeatedly writes sympathetically of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>&ldquo;free philosophers&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e1484src" href="#xd25e1484" name="xd25e1484src">23</a> and
&ldquo;free philosophy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1499src"
href="#xd25e1499" name="xd25e1499src">24</a> In 1667 we find Sprat, the
historian of the Royal Society, describing the activity of that body as
having arisen or taken its special direction through the conviction
that in science, as in warfare, better results had been obtained by a
&ldquo;free way&rdquo; than by methods not so describable.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1507src" href="#xd25e1507" name=
"xd25e1507src">25</a> As Sprat is careful to insist, the members of the
Royal Society, though looked at askance by most of the clergy<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1512src" href="#xd25e1512" name=
"xd25e1512src">26</a> and other pietists, were not as such to be
classed as unbelievers, the leading members being strictly orthodox;
but a certain number seem to have shown scant concern for
religion;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1519src" href="#xd25e1519" name=
"xd25e1519src">27</a> and while it was one of the Society&rsquo;s first
rules not to debate any theological question whatever,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e1522src" href="#xd25e1522" name=
"xd25e1522src">28</a> the intellectual atmosphere of the time was such
that some among those who followed the &ldquo;free way&rdquo; in
matters of natural science would be extremely likely to apply it to
more familiar problems.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1527src" href=
"#xd25e1527" name="xd25e1527src">29</a> At the same period we find
Spinoza devoting his <i lang="la">Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</i>
(1670) to the advocacy of <i lang="la">libertas philosophandi</i>; and
such a work was bound to have a general European influence. It was
probably, then, a result of such express assertion of the need and
value of freedom in the mental life that the name
&ldquo;freethinker&rdquo; came into English use in the last quarter of
the century.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Before &ldquo;deism&rdquo; came into English vogue,
the names for unbelief, even deistic, were simply
&ldquo;infidelity&rdquo; and &ldquo;atheism&rdquo;&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
Bishop Fotherby&rsquo;s <i>Atheomastix</i> (1622), Baxter&rsquo;s
<i>Unreasonableness of Infidelity</i> (1655) and <i>Reasons of the
Christian Religion</i> (1667), <i>passim</i>. Bishop
Stillingfleet&rsquo;s <i>Letter to a Deist</i> (1677) appears to be the
first published attack on deism by name. His <i lang="la">Origines
Sacr&aelig;</i> (1662) deals chiefly with deistic views, but calls
unbelievers in general &ldquo;atheists.&rdquo; Cudworth, in his <i>True
Intellectual System of the Universe</i> (written 1671, published 1678),
does not speak of deism, attacking only atheism, and was himself
suspected of Socinianism. W. Sherlock, in his <i>Practical Discourse of
Religious Assemblies</i> (2nd ed., 1682), attacks &ldquo;atheists and
infidels,&rdquo; but says nothing of &ldquo;deists.&rdquo; That term,
first coined, as we have seen, in French, seems first to have found
common currency in France&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, on the title-pages of the
apologetic works of Marin Mersenne, 1623 and 1624. The term
&ldquo;atheist&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5"
name="pb5">5</a>]</span>was often applied at random at this period; but
atheism did exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the orthodox Boyle pushed criticism in physical science under
such a title as <i>The Sceptical Chemist</i>, the principle could not
well be withheld from application to religion; and it lay in the nature
of the case that the name &ldquo;freethinker,&rdquo; like that of
&ldquo;skeptic,&rdquo; should come to attach itself specially to those
who doubted where doubt was most resented and most resisted. At length
the former term became specific.</p>
<p>In the meantime the word &ldquo;rationalist,&rdquo; which in English
has latterly tended to become the prevailing name for freethinkers, had
made its appearance, without securing much currency. In a London
news-letter dated October 14, 1646, it is stated, concerning the
Presbyterians and Independents, that &ldquo;there is a new sect sprung
up among them, and these are the <i>rationalists</i>; and what their
reason dictates to them in Church or State stands for good until they
be convinced with better.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1583src"
href="#xd25e1583" name="xd25e1583src">30</a> On the Continent, the
equivalent Latin term (<i lang="la">rationalista</i>) had been applied
about the beginning of the century to the Aristotelian humanists of the
Helmstadt school by their opponents,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1595src" href="#xd25e1595" name="xd25e1595src">31</a> apparently
in the same sense as that in which Bacon used the term
<i>rationales</i> in his <i lang="la">Redargutio
Philosophiarum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;<span lang="la">Rationales autem,
aranearum more, telas ex se conficiunt.</span>&rdquo; Under this title
he contrasts (as spiders spinning webs out of themselves) the mere
Aristotelean speculators, who framed &agrave; priori schemes of Nature,
with empiricists, who, &ldquo;like ants, collect something and use
it,&rdquo; preferring to both the &ldquo;bees&rdquo; who should follow
the ideal method prescribed by himself.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1614src" href="#xd25e1614" name="xd25e1614src">32</a> There is
here no allusion to heterodox opinion on religion. [Bishop Hurst, who
(perhaps following the <i>Apophthegms</i>) puts a translation of
Bacon&rsquo;s words, with &ldquo;rationalists&rdquo; for
<i>rationales</i>, as one of the mottoes of his <i>History of
Rationalism</i>, is thus misleading his readers as to Bacon&rsquo;s
meaning.] In 1661 John Amos Comenius, in his <i lang="la">Theologia
Naturalis</i>, applies the name <i lang="la">rationalista</i> to the
Socinians and deists; without, however, leading to its general use in
that sense. Later we shall meet with the term in English discussions
between 1680 and 1715, applied usually to rationalizing Christians; but
as a name for opponents of orthodox religion it was for the time
superseded, in English, by &ldquo;freethinker.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the course of the eighteenth century the term was adopted in
other languages. The first French translation (1714) of Collins&rsquo;s
<i>Discourse of Freethinking</i> is entitled <i lang="fr">Discours sur
la libert&eacute; de penser</i>; and the term
&ldquo;freethinkers&rdquo; is translated on the title-page by <i lang=
"fr">esprit fort</i>, and in the text by a periphrasis of <i lang=
"fr">libert&eacute; de penser</i>. Later in the century, however, we
find Voltaire in his correspondence frequently using the substantive
<i lang="fr">franc-pensant</i>, a translation of the English term which
subsequently gave way to <i lang="fr">libre penseur</i>. The modern
German term <i lang="de">Freigeist</i>, found as early as 1702 in the
allusion to &ldquo;<span lang="de">Alten Qu&auml;cker und neuen
Frey-Geister</span>&rdquo; on the title-page of the folio <i lang=
"la">Anabaptisticum et Enthusiasticum Pantheon</i>, probably derives
from the old &ldquo;Brethren of the Free Spirit&rdquo;; while <i lang=
"de">Sch&ouml;ngeist</i> arose as a translation of <i lang="fr">bel
esprit</i>. In the middle of the eighteenth century <i lang=
"de">Freidenker</i> came into German use as a translation of the
English term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In a general sense &ldquo;free thoughts&rdquo; was a
natural expression, and we have it in Ben Jonson: &ldquo;Being free
master of mine own free thoughts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1688src" href="#xd25e1688" name="xd25e1688src">33</a> But not
till about the year 1700 did the phrase begin to have a special
application to religious matters. The first certain instance thus far
noted of the use of the term &ldquo;freethinker&rdquo; is in a letter
of Molyneux to Locke, dated April 6, 1697,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1693src" href="#xd25e1693" name="xd25e1693src">34</a> where
Toland is spoken of as a &ldquo;candid freethinker.&rdquo; In an
earlier letter, dated December 24, 1695, Molyneux speaks of a certain
book on religion as somewhat lacking in &ldquo;freedom of
thought&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1698src" href="#xd25e1698"
name="xd25e1698src">35</a> and in Burnet&rsquo;s
<i>Letters</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e1705src" href="#xd25e1705"
name="xd25e1705src">36</a> occurs still earlier the expression
&ldquo;men &hellip; of freer thoughts.&rdquo; In the <i>New English
Dictionary</i> a citation is given from the title-page of S.
Smith&rsquo;s brochure, <i>The Religious Impostor &hellip; dedicated to
Doctor S-l-m-n and the rest of the new Religious Fraternity of
Freethinkers, near Leather-Sellers&rsquo; Hall. Printed &hellip; in the
first year of Grace and Freethinking</i>, conjecturally dated 1692. It
is thought to refer to the sect of &ldquo;Freeseekers&rdquo; mentioned
in Luttrell&rsquo;s <i>Brief Historical Relation</i> (iii, 56) under
date 1693. In that case it is not unbelievers that are in question. So
in Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <i>Inquiry Concerning Virtue</i> (first ed.
1699) the expression &ldquo;freethought&rdquo; has a general and not a
particular sense;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1721src" href="#xd25e1721"
name="xd25e1721src">37</a> and in Baker&rsquo;s <i>Reflections upon
Learning</i>, also published in 1699, in the remark: &ldquo;After the
way of freethinking had been lai&rsquo;d open by my Lord Bacon, it was
soon after greedily followed&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e1727src" href="#xd25e1727" name="xd25e1727src">38</a> the
reference is, of course, to scientific and not to religious thought.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>But in Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <i>Essay on the Freedom of Wit and
Humour</i> (1709) the phrases &ldquo;free-writers&rdquo; and &ldquo;a
freethought&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1740src" href=
"#xd25e1740" name="xd25e1740src">39</a> have reference to
&ldquo;advanced&rdquo; opinions, though in his letters to Ainsworth
(May 10, 1707) he had written, &ldquo;I am glad to find your love of
reason and <i>freethought</i>. Your piety and virtue I know you will
always keep.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1746src" href=
"#xd25e1746" name="xd25e1746src">40</a> Compare the <i>Miscellaneous
Reflections</i> (v, 3) in the <i>Characteristics</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd25e1757src" href="#xd25e1757" name="xd25e1757src">41</a> (1711),
where the tendency to force the sense from the general to the special
is incidentally illustrated. Shaftesbury, however, includes the term
&ldquo;free liver&rdquo; among the &ldquo;naturally honest
appellations&rdquo; that have become opprobrious.</p>
<p>In Swift&rsquo;s <i>Sentiments of a Church of England Man</i> (1708)
the specialized word is found definitely and abusively connoting
religious unbelief: &ldquo;The atheists, libertines, despisers of
religion&mdash;that is to say, all those who usually pass under the
name of freethinkers&rdquo;; Steele and Addison so use it in the
<i>Tatler</i> in 1709;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1768src" href=
"#xd25e1768" name="xd25e1768src">42</a> and Leslie so uses the term in
his <i>Truth of Christianity Demonstrated</i> (1711). The anonymous
essay, <i>R&eacute;flexions sur les grands hommes qui sont morts en
plaisantant</i>, by Deslandes (Amsterdam, 1712), is translated in
English (1713) as <i>Reflections on the Death of Free-thinkers</i>, and
the translator uses the term in his prefatory Letter to the Author,
beside putting it in the text (pp. 50, 85, 97, 102, 106, etc.), where
the original had <i lang="fr">esprit fort</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not till 1713, however, that Anthony Collins&rsquo;s
<i>Discourse of Freethinking, occasioned by the Rise and Growth of a
Sect called Freethinkers</i>, gave the word a universal notoriety, and
brought it into established currency in controversy, with the normal
significance of &ldquo;deist,&rdquo; Collins having entirely repudiated
atheism. Even after this date, and indeed in full conformity with the
definition in Collins&rsquo;s opening sentence, Ambrose Philips took
<i>The Freethinker</i> as the title of a weekly journal (begun in 1718)
on the lines of the <i>Spectator</i>, with no heterodox
leaning,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1796src" href="#xd25e1796" name=
"xd25e1796src">43</a> the contributors including Boulter, afterwards
Archbishop of Dublin, and the son of Bishop Burnet. But despite this
attempt to keep the word &ldquo;freethinking&rdquo; as a name for
simple freedom from prejudice in secular affairs, the tendency to
specialize it as aforesaid was irresistible. As names go, it was on the
whole a good one; and the bitterness with which it was generally
handled on the orthodox side showed that its implicit claim was felt to
be disturbing, though some antagonists of course claimed from the first
that they were as &ldquo;free&rdquo; under the law of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>right reason
as any skeptic.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1808src" href="#xd25e1808"
name="xd25e1808src">44</a> At this time of day the word may be allowed
prescriptive standing, as having no more drawbacks than most other
names for schools of thought or attitudes of mind, and as having been
admitted into most European languages. The question-begging element is
not greater in this than in many other terms of similar intention, such
as &ldquo;rationalism&rdquo;; and it incurs no such charge of absurdity
as lies against the invidious religious term, &ldquo;infidelity.&rdquo;
The term &ldquo;infidel&rdquo; invites &ldquo;fidel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A plausible objection may, indeed, arise on the score that such a
term as &ldquo;freethought&rdquo; should not be set up by thinkers who
almost invariably reject the term &ldquo;freewill&rdquo;&mdash;the
rationalistic succession having for two hundred and fifty years been
carried on mainly by determinists. But the issues raised by the two
terms are on wholly different planes; and while in both cases the
imperfection of the instrument of language is apparent, it is not in
the present case a cause of psychological confusion, as it is in the
discussion of the nature of will. The freewill fallacy consists in
applying universally to the process of judgment and preference (which
is a process of natural causation like another) a conception relevant
only to human or animal <i>action</i>, as interfered with or unaffected
by <i>extraneous</i> compulsion. To the processes of nature, organic or
inorganic, the concepts &ldquo;free&rdquo; and &ldquo;bond&rdquo; are
equally irrelevant: a tiger is no more &ldquo;free&rdquo; to crave for
grass and recoil from flesh than is water to flow uphill; while, on the
other hand, such &ldquo;appetites&rdquo; are not rationally to be
described as forms of bondage. Only as a mode distinguishable from its
contrary can &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; be predicated of any procedure, and
it is so predicated of actions; whereas the whole category of volitions
is alleged and denied by the verbal disputants to be
&ldquo;free.&rdquo; Some attempt to save the case by distinguishing
between free and alleged &ldquo;unfree&rdquo; volitions; but the latter
are found to be simply cases of choices dictated by intense need, as in
the case of deadly thirst. The difference, therefore, is only one of
degree of impulse, not in the fact of choice.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;freewill,&rdquo; therefore, is irrational, as being
wholly irrelevant to the conception of volition. But
&ldquo;freethought,&rdquo; on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href=
"#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>the other hand, points to an actual
difference in <i>degree of employment of the faculty of criticism</i>.
The proposition is that some men think more &ldquo;freely&rdquo; than
others in that they are (<i>a</i>) not terrorized by any veto on
criticism, and (<i>b</i>) not hampered, or less hampered, by ignorant
pre-suppositions. In both cases there is a real discrimination. There
is no allegation that, absolutely speaking, &ldquo;thought is
free&rdquo; in the sense of the orthodox formula; on the contrary, it
is asserted that the rationalist&rsquo;s critical course is
specifically determined by his intellectual structure and his
preparation, and that it is sometimes different structure, but more
often different preparation, that determines the anti-critical or
counter-critical attitude of the believer. Change in the preparation,
it is contended, will put the latter in fuller use of his potential
resources; his inculcated fear of doubt and docility of assent being
simply acquiescences in vetoes on his <i>attention</i> to certain
matters for reflection&mdash;that is to say, in arbitrary limitations
of his action. It is further implied that the instructed man, other
things being equal, is &ldquo;freer&rdquo; to think than the
uninstructed, as being less obstructed; but for the purpose of our
history it is sufficient to posit the discriminations above noted.</p>
<p>The essential thing to be realized is the fact that from its
earliest stages humanity has suffered from conventional or traditionary
hindrances to the use of judgment. This holds good even as to the early
play of the simple inventive faculty, all innovations in implements
being met by the inertia of habit; and when men reached the stages of
ritual practice, social construction, and religious doctrine, the
forces of repression became powerful in proportion to the seriousness
of the problem. It is only in modern times that freedom in these
relations has come to be generally regarded as permissible; and it has
always been over questions of religion that the strife has been
keenest.</p>
<p>For practical purposes, then, freethought may be defined as a
conscious reaction against some phase or phases of conventional or
traditional doctrine in religion&mdash;on the one hand, a claim to
think freely, in the sense not of disregard for logic, but of special
loyalty to it, on problems to which the past course of things has given
a great intellectual and practical importance; on the other hand, the
actual practice of such thinking. This sense, which is substantially
agreed on, will on one or other side sufficiently cover those phenomena
of early or rudimentary freethinking which wear the guise of simple
concrete opposition to given doctrines or systems, whether by way of
special demur or of the obtrusion of a new cult or doctrine. In either
case, the claim to think in a measure freely is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>implicit
in the criticism or the new affirmation; and such primary movements of
the mind cannot well be separated, in psychology or in history, from
the fully conscious practice of criticism in the spirit of pure
truth-seeking, or from the claim that such free examination is
profoundly important to moral and intellectual health. Modern
freethought, specially so-called, is only one of the developments of
the slight primary capacity of man to doubt, to reason, to improve on
past thinking, to assert his personality as against sacrosanct and
menacing authority. Concretely considered, it has proceeded by the
support and stimulus of successive accretions of actual knowledge; and
the modern consciousness of its own abstract importance emerged by way
of an impression or inference from certain social phenomena, as well as
in terms of self-asserting instinct. There is no break in its evolution
from primitive mental states, any more than in the evolution of the
natural sciences from primitive observation. What particularly accrues
to the state of conscious and systematic discrimination, in the one
case as in the other, is just the immense gain in security of
possession.</p>

<p class="first">It is somewhat remarkable that in England this
phenomenon has thus far<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1867src" href=
"#xd25e1867" name="xd25e1867src">45</a> had no general historic
treatment save at the hands of ecclesiastical writers, who, in most
cases, have regarded it solely as a form of more or less perverse
hostility to their own creed. The modern scientific study of religions,
which has yielded so many instructive surveys, almost of necessity
excludes from view the specific play of freethought, which in the
religion-making periods is to be traced rather by its religious results
than by any record of its expression. All histories of philosophy,
indeed, in some degree necessarily recognize it; and such a work as
Lange&rsquo;s <i>History of Materialism</i> may be regarded as
part&mdash;whether or not sound in its historical treatment&mdash;of a
complete history of freethought, dealing specially with general
philosophic problems. But of freethought as a reasoned revision or
rejection of current religious doctrines by more or less practical
people, we have no regular history by a professed freethinker, though
there are many monographs and surveys of periods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The latest and freshest sketch of the kind is
Professor J. B. Bury&rsquo;s brief <i>History of Freedom of Thought</i>
(1913), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>notable for the force of its championship of the
law of liberty. The useful compilation of the late Mr. Charles Watts,
entitled <i>Freethought: Its Rise, Progress, and Triumph</i> (n. d.),
deals with freethought in relation only to Christianity. Apart from
treatises which broadly sketch the development of knowledge and of
opinion, the nearest approaches to a general historic treatment are the
<i lang="fr">Dictionnaire des Ath&eacute;es</i> of Sylvain
Mar&eacute;chal (1800: 3e &eacute;dit., par J. B. L. Germond, 1853) and
the <i>Biographical Dictionary of Freethinkers</i> by the late Joseph
Mazzini Wheeler. The quaint work of Mar&eacute;chal, expanded by his
friend Lalande, exhibits much learning, but is made partly fantastic by
its sardonic plan of including a number of typical religionists
(including Job, John, and Jesus Christ!), some of whose utterances are
held to lead logically to atheism. Mr. Wheeler&rsquo;s book is in every
respect the more trustworthy.</p>
<p>In excuse of Mar&eacute;chal&rsquo;s method, it may be noted that
the prevailing practice of Christian apologists had been to impute
atheism to heterodox theistic thinkers of all ages. The <i lang=
"la">Historia universalis Atheismi et Atheorum falso et merito
suspectorum</i> of J. F. Reimmann (Hildesi&aelig;, 1725) exhibits this
habit both in its criticism and in its practice, as do the <i lang=
"la">Theses de Atheismo et Superstitione</i> of Buddeus (Trajecti ad
Rhenum, 1716). These were the standard treatises of their kind for the
eighteenth century, and seem to be the earliest systematic treatises in
the nature of a history of freethought, excepting a <i lang=
"la">Historia Naturalismi</i> by A. Tribbechov (Jen&aelig;, 1700) and a
<i lang="la">Historia Atheismi breviter delineata</i> by Jenkinus
Thomasius (Altdorf, 1692; Basile&aelig;, 1709; London, 1716). In the
same year with Reimmann&rsquo;s <i lang="la">Historia</i> appeared J.
A. Fabricius&rsquo;s <i lang="la">Delectus Argumentorum et Syllabus
scriptorum qui veritatem religionis Christian&aelig; adversus Atheos,
Epicureos, Deistas, seu Naturalistas &hellip; asseruerunt</i>
(Hamburghi), in which it is contended (cap. viii) that many
philosophers have been falsely described as atheists; but in the
<i lang="de">Freydenker Lexicon</i> of J. A. Trinius (Leipzig, 1759),
planned as a supplement to the work of Fabricius, are included such
writers as Sir Thomas Browne and Dryden.</p>
<p>The works of the late Rev. John Owen, <i>Evenings with the
Skeptics</i>, <i>Skeptics of the Italian Renaissance</i>, and
<i>Skeptics of the French Renaissance</i>, which, though not
constituting a literary whole, collectively cover a great deal of
historical ground, must be expressly excepted from the above
characterization of clerical histories of freethought, in respect of
their liberality of view. They deal largely, however, with general or
philosophical skepticism, which is a special development of
freethought, often by way of reasonings in which many freethinkers do
not acquiesce. (All strict skeptics, that is to say&mdash;as
distinguished from religionists who profess skepticism up to a certain
point by way of making a surrender to orthodox <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>dogmatism<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1927src"
href="#xd25e1927" name="xd25e1927src">46</a>&mdash;are freethinkers;
but most freethinkers are not strictly skeptics.) The history of
philosophic skepticism, again, is properly and methodically treated in
the old work of Carl Friedrich St&auml;udlin, <i lang="de">Geschichte
und Geist des Skepticismus</i> (2 Bde., Leipzig, 1794), the historic
survey being divided into six periods: 1, Before Pyrrho; 2, from Pyrrho
to Sextus; 3, from Sextus to Montaigne; 4, from Montaigne to La Mothe
le Vayer; 5, from La Mothe le Vayer to Hume; 6, from Hume to Kant and
Platner. The posthumous work of &Eacute;mile Saisset, <i lang="fr">Le
Scepticisme: &AElig;n&eacute;sid&egrave;me&mdash;Pascal&mdash;Kant</i>
(1865), is a fragment of a projected complete history of philosophic
skepticism.</p>
<p>St&auml;udlin&rsquo;s later work, the <i lang="de">Geschichte des
Rationalismus und Supernaturalismus</i> (1826), is a shorter but more
general history of the strife between general freethought and
supernaturalism in the Christian world and era. It deals cursorily with
the intellectual attitude of the early Fathers, the early heretics, and
the Scholastics; proceeding to a fuller survey of the developments
since the Reformation, and covering Unitarianism, Latitudinarianism,
English and French Deism, and German Rationalism of different shades
down to the date of writing. St&auml;udlin may be described as a
rationalizing supernaturalist.</p>
<p>Like most works on religious and intellectual history written from a
religious standpoint, those of St&auml;udlin treat the phenomena as it
were <i lang="la">in vacuo</i>, with little regard to the conditioning
circumstances, economic and political; critical thought being regarded
purely as a force proceeding through its own proclivities. Saisset is
at very much the same point of view. Needless to say, valuable work may
be done up to a certain point on this method, which is seen in full
play in Hegel; and high praise is due to the learned and thoughtful
treatise of R. W. Mackay, <i>The Progress of the Intellect as
Exemplified in the Religious Development of the Greeks and Hebrews</i>
(2 vols. 1850), where it is partially but ably supplemented by the
method of inductive science. That method, again, is freshly and
forcibly applied to a restricted problem in W. A. Schmidt&rsquo;s
<i lang="de">Geschichte der Denk- und Glaubensfreiheit im ersten
Jahrhundert der Kaiserherrschaft und des Christenthums</i> (1847).</p>
<p>Later come the <i lang="de">Vorgeschichte des Rationalismus</i>
(1853&ndash;62) and <i lang="de">Geschichte des Rationalismus</i>
(1865) of the theologian Tholuck. Of these the latter is unfinished,
coming down only to the middle of the eighteenth century; while the
former does not exactly fulfil its title, being composed of a volume (2
Abth. 1853, 1854) on <i lang="de">Das akademische Leben des 17ten
Jahrhunderts</i>, and of one on <i lang="de">Das kirchliche Leben des
17ten Jahrhunderts</i> (2 Abth. 1861, 1862), both being restricted to
German developments. They thus give much matter extraneous to the
subject, and are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>not exhaustive as to rationalism even in Germany.
Hagenbach&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Die Kirchengeschichte des 18. und 19.
Jahrhunderts</i> (2 Th. 1848, 1849), a series of lectures, translated
in English, abridged, under the title <i>German Rationalism in its
Rise, Progress, and Decline</i> (1865), conforms fairly to the latter
title, save as regards the last clause.</p>
<p>Of much greater scholarly merit is the <i lang="de">Geschichte der
religi&ouml;sen Aufkl&auml;rung im Mittelalter, vom Ende des achten
Jahrhunderts bis zum Anfange des vierzehnten</i>, by Hermann Reuter
(1875, 1877). This is at once learned, judicious, and impartial. Its
definition of &ldquo;<i lang="de">Aufkl&auml;rung</i>&rdquo; is
substantially in agreement with the working definition of Freethought
given above.</p>
<p>Among other surveys of periods of innovating thought, as
distinguished from histories of ecclesiastical heresy, or histories of
&ldquo;religious&rdquo; or theological thought which only incidentally
deal with heterodox opinion, should be noted the careful <i lang=
"de">Geschichte des englischen Deismus</i> of G. F. Lechler (1841); the
slighter sketch of E. Sayous, <i lang="fr">Les d&eacute;istes anglais
et le Christianisme</i> (1882); the somewhat diffuse work of Cesare
Cant&ugrave;, <i lang="it">Gli eretici d&rsquo;Italia</i> (3 tom.
1865&ndash;67); the very intelligent study of Felice Tocco, <i lang=
"it">L&rsquo;Eresia nel medio evo</i> (1884); Schmidt&rsquo;s <i lang=
"fr">Histoire des Cathares</i> (2 tom. 1849); Chr. U. Hahn&rsquo;s
learned <i lang="de">Geschichte der Ketzer im Mittelalter</i> (3 Bde.
1845&ndash;50); and the valuable research of F. T. Perrens, <i lang=
"fr">Les Libertins en France au xviie si&egrave;cle</i> (1896). A
similar scholarly research for the eighteenth century in France is
still lacking, and the many monographs on the more famous freethinkers
leave a good deal of literary history in obscurity. Such a research has
been very painstakingly made for England in the late Sir Leslie
Stephen&rsquo;s <i>History of English Thought in the Eighteenth
Century</i> (2 vols., 2nd ed., 1881), which, however, ignores
scientific thought. One of the best monographs of the kind is <i lang=
"fr">La Critique des traditions religieuses chez les Grecs, des
origines au temps de Plutarque</i>, by Professor Paul Decharme (1904),
a survey at once scholarly and attractive. The brilliant treatise of
Mr. F. M. Cornford, <i>From Religion to Philosophy</i> (1912), sketches
on more speculative lines the beginnings of Greek rationalism in Ionia.
The <i lang="de">Geschichte des Monismus im Altertum</i> of Prof. Dr.
A. Drews (1913) is a wide survey, of great synthetic value.</p>
<p>Contributions to the general history of freethought, further, have
been made in the works of J. W. Draper (<i>A History of the
Intellectual Development of Europe</i>, 2 vols, 1861, many reprints;
and <i>History of the Conflict between Religion and Science</i>, 1873,
many reprints), both full of suggestion and stimulus, but requiring
thorough revision as to detail; in the famous <i>Introduction to the
History of Civilization in England</i> of H. T. Buckle (2 vols.
1857&ndash;61; new ed. in 1 vol. with annotations by the present
writer, 1904); in the <i>History of the Rise and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism in
Europe</i> of W. E. H. Lecky (2 vols. 1865; R. P. A. rep. 1910), who
was of Buckle&rsquo;s school, but fell below him in point of coherence;
in the comprehensive <i>History of the Warfare of Science with
Theology</i> of Professor Andrew D. White (2 vols. 1896&mdash;a great
expansion of his earlier essay, <i>The Warfare of Science</i>, 2nd ed.
1877); and in the essay of Mr. E. S. P. Haynes, <i>Religious
Persecution: A Study in Political Psychology</i> (1904; R. P. A. rep.
1906), as well as in many histories of philosophy and of sciences.</p>
<p>The so-called <i>History of Rationalism</i> of the American Bishop
J. F. Hurst, first published in 1865, and &ldquo;revised&rdquo; in
1901, is in the main a work of <i lang="la">odium theologicum</i>,
dealing chiefly with the evolution of theology and criticism in Germany
since the Reformation. Even to that purpose it is very inadequate. Its
preface alleges that &ldquo;happily the vital body of evangelical truth
has received only comparatively weak and timorous attacks from the more
modern representatives of the rank and rabid rationalism which reached
its climax near the close of the eighteenth, and has had a continuous
decline through the nineteenth, century.&rdquo; It urges, however, as a
reason for defensive activity, the consideration that &ldquo;the work
of Satan is never planless&rdquo;; and further pronounces that the work
of rationalism &ldquo;must determine its character. This work has been
most injurious to the faith and life of the Church, and its deeds must
therefore be its condemnation&rdquo; (Introd. p. 3). Thus the latest
approximation to a history of theological rationalism by a clerical
writer is the most negligible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English, apart from studies of given periods and of the progress
of science and culture, the only other approaches to a history of
freethought are those of Bishop Van Mildert, the Rev. J. E. Riddle, and
the Rev. Adam Storey Farrar. Van Mildert&rsquo;s <i>Historical View of
the Rise and Progress of Infidelity</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2062src" href="#xd25e2062" name="xd25e2062src">47</a> constituted
the Boyle Lectures for 1802&ndash;05; Mr. Riddle&rsquo;s <i>Natural
History of Infidelity and Superstition in Contrast with Christian
Faith</i> formed part of his Bampton Lectures for 1852; and Mr. Farrar
produced his <i>Critical History of Freethought in reference to the
Christian Religion</i> as the Bampton Lectures for 1862. All three were
men of considerable reading, and their works give useful <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e2071" title=
"Source: bibiographical">bibliographical</span> clues; but the
virulence of Van Mildert deprives his treatise of rational weight; Mr.
Riddle, who in any case professes to give merely a &ldquo;Natural
History&rdquo; or abstract argument, and not a history proper, is only
somewhat more constrainedly hostile to &ldquo;infidelity&rdquo;; and
even Mr. Farrar, the most judicial as well as the most comprehensive of
the three, proceeds on the old assumption that &ldquo;unbelief&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>(from which he charitably distinguishes
&ldquo;doubt&rdquo;) generally arises from &ldquo;antagonism of
feeling, which wishes revelation untrue&rdquo;&mdash;a thesis
maintained with vehemence by the others.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2077src" href="#xd25e2077" name="xd25e2077src">48</a></p>
<p>Writers so placed, indeed, could not well be expected to contemplate
freethought scientifically as an aspect of mental evolution common to
all civilizations, any more than to look with sympathy on the
freethought which is specifically anti-Christian. The annotations to
all three works, certainly, show some consciousness of the need for
another temper and method than that of their text,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e2082src" href="#xd25e2082" name="xd25e2082src">49</a> which is
too obviously, perhaps inevitably, composed for the satisfaction of the
ordinary orthodox animus of their respective periods; but even the best
remains not so much a history as an indictment. In the present sketch,
framed though it be from the rationalistic standpoint, it is proposed
to draw up not a counter indictment, but a more or less dispassionate
account of the main historical phases of freethought, viewed on the one
hand as expressions of the rational or critical spirit, playing on the
subject-matter of religion, and on the other hand as sociological
phenomena conditioned by social forces, in particular the economic and
political. The lack of any previous general survey of a scientific
character will, it is hoped, be taken into account in passing judgment
on its schematic defects as well as its inevitable flaws of detail.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&sect; 3. <i>The Psychology of Freethinking</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though it is no part of our business here to elaborate
the psychology of doubt and belief, it may be well to anticipate a
possible criticism on the lines of recent psychological speculation,
and to indicate at the outset the practical conception on which the
present survey broadly proceeds. To begin with, the conception of
freethinking implies that of hindrance, resistance, coercion,
difficulty; and as regards objective obstacles the type of all
hindrance is restraint upon freedom of speech or publication. In other
words, all such restraint is a check upon thinking. On reflection it
soon becomes clear that where men dare not say or write what they
think, the very power of thinking is at length impaired in the ablest,
while the natural stimulus to new thought is withdrawn from the rest.
No man can properly develop his mind without contact with other minds,
suggestion and criticism being alike factors in every fruitful mental
evolution; and though for some the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16"
href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>atmosphere of personal
intercourse is but slightly necessary to the process of mental
construction, even for these the prospect of promulgation is probably
essential to the undertaking of the task; and the study of other
<i>writers</i> is a condition of useful ratiocination. In any case, it
is certain that the exercise of argument is a condition of intellectual
growth. Not one man in a million will or can argue closely with himself
on issues on which he knows he can say nothing and can never overtly
act; and for the average man all reasoning on great problems is a
matter of prompting from without. The simple fact that the conversation
of uneducated people runs so largely to citation of what &ldquo;he
says&rdquo; makes clear this dependence. Each brings something to the
common store, and progress is set up by &ldquo;pooling&rdquo; the mass
of small intellectual variations or originalities. Thus in the long run
freedom of speech is the measure of a generation&rsquo;s intellectual
capacity;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2100src" href="#xd25e2100" name=
"xd25e2100src">50</a> and the promoters of such freedom are typically
the truest servants of progress.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is still a common disposition to ascribe to
a species of intellectual malice the disturbance that criticism causes
to the holders of established beliefs. Recent writers have pressed far
the theorem that &ldquo;will&rdquo; enters as an element into every
mental act, thus giving a momentary appearance of support to the old
formula that unbelief is the result of an arbitrary or sinister
perversity of individual choice. Needless to say, however, the new
theorem&mdash;which inverts without refuting Spinoza&rsquo;s denial of
the entity of volition&mdash;applies equally to acts of belief; and it
is a matter of the simplest concrete observation that, in so far as
will or wilfulness in the ordinary sense operates in the sphere of
religion, it is at least as obvious and as active on the side of
belief<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2108src" href="#xd25e2108" name=
"xd25e2108src">51</a> as on the other. A moment&rsquo;s reflection on
the historic phenomena of orthodox resistance to criticism will satisfy
any student that, whatever may have been the stimulus on the side of
heresy, the antagonism it arouses is largely the index of primary
passion&mdash;the spontaneous resentment of the believer whose habits
are disturbed. His will normally decides his action, without any
process of judicial deliberation.</p>
<p>It is another way of stating the same fact to point out the fallacy
of the familiar assumption that freethinking represents a bias to
&ldquo;negation.&rdquo; In the nature of the case, the believer has to
do at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>least as much negation as his opponents; and if
again we scan history in this connection, we shall see cause to
conclude that the temperamental tendency to negation&mdash;which is a
form of variation like another<span class="corr" id="xd25e2121" title=
"Source: - -">&mdash;</span>is abundantly common on the side of
religious conservatism. Nowhere is there more habitual opposition to
new ideas as such. At best the believer, so-called, rejects a given
proposition or suggestion because it clashes with something he already
believes. The new proposition, however, has often been reached by way
not of preliminary negation of the belief in question, but of
constructive explanation, undertaken to bring observed facts into
theoretic harmony. Thus the innovator has only contingently put aside
the old belief because <i>it</i> clashes with something he believes in
a more vital way; and he has done this with circumspection, whereas his
opponent too often repels him without a second thought. The phenomena
of the rise of the Copernican astronomy, modern geology, and modern
biology, all bear out this generalization.</p>
<p>Nor is the charge of negativeness any more generally valid against
such freethinking as directly assails current doctrines. There may be,
of course, negative-minded people on that side as on the other; and
such may fortuitously do something to promote freethought, or may
damage it in their neighbourhood by their atmosphere. But everything
goes to show that freethinking normally proceeds by way of intellectual
construction&mdash;that is, by way of effort to harmonize one position
with another; to modify a special dogma to the general run of
one&rsquo;s thinking. Rationalism stands not for
&ldquo;skepticism&rdquo; in the strict philosophic sense, but for a
critical effort to reach certainties. The attitude of pure skepticism
on a wide scale is really very rare&mdash;much rarer even than the
philosophic effort. So far from freethinkers being given to
&ldquo;destroying without building up,&rdquo; they are, as a rule,
unable to destroy a dogma either for themselves or for others without
setting a constructive belief in its place&mdash;a form of explanation,
that is; such being much more truly a process of construction than
would be the imposition of a new scheme of dogma. In point of fact,
they are often accused, and by the same critics, of an undue tendency
to speculative construction; and the early atheists of Greece and of
the modern period did so err. But that is only a proof the more that
their freethinking was not a matter of arbitrary volition or an undue
negativeness.</p>
<p>The only explanation which ostensibly countervails this is the old
one above glanced at&mdash;that the unbeliever finds the given doctrine
troublesome as a restraint, and so determines to reject it. It is to be
feared that this view has survived Mr. A. S. Farrar. Yet it is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>very clear that no man need throw aside any faith,
and least of all Christianity, on the ground of its hampering his
conduct. To say nothing of the fact that in every age, under every
religion, at every stage of culture from that of the savage to that of
the supersubtle decadent or mystic, men have practised every kind of
misconduct without abandoning their supernatural credences&mdash;there
is the special fact that the whole Christian system rests on the
doctrine of forgiveness of sins to the believer. The theory of
&ldquo;wilful&rdquo; disbelief on the part of the reprobate is thus
entirely unplausible. Such disbelief in the terms of the case would be
uneasy, as involving an element of incertitude; and his fear of
retribution could never be laid. On the other hand, he has but inwardly
to avow himself a sinner and a believer, and he has the assurance that
repentance at the last moment will outweigh all his sins.</p>
<p>It is not, of course, suggested that such is the normal or frequent
course of believing Christians; but it has been so often enough to make
the &ldquo;libertine&rdquo; theory of unbelief untenable. Indeed, the
singular diversity between profession and practice among Christians has
in all periods called out declarations by the more fervid believers
that their average fellow-Christians are &ldquo;practical
atheists.&rdquo; More judicial minds may be set asking instead how far
men really &ldquo;believe&rdquo; who do not act on their opinions. As
one high authority has put it, in the Middle Ages the normal opposition
of theory and practice &ldquo;was peculiarly abrupt. Men&rsquo;s
impulses were more violent, and their conduct more reckless, than is
often witnessed in modern society; while the absence of a criticizing
and measuring spirit made them surrender their minds more unreservedly
than they would do now to a complete and imposing
theory&#8202;&hellip;. Resistance to God&rsquo;s Vicar might be, and
indeed was admitted to be, a deadly sin, but it was one which nobody
hesitated to commit.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2135src" href=
"#xd25e2135" name="xd25e2135src">52</a> And so with other sins, the
sinner having somewhere in the rear of his consciousness the reflection
that his sins could be absolved.</p>
<p>And, apart from such half-purposive forms of licence among
Christians, there have been countless cases of purposive licence. In
all ages there have been antinomian Christians,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2143src" href="#xd25e2143" name="xd25e2143src">53</a> whether of
the sort that simply rest on the &ldquo;seventy times seven&rdquo; of
the Gospel, or of the more articulately logical kind who dwell on the
doctrine of faith <i>versus</i> works. For the rest, as the considerate
theologian will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>readily see, insistence on the possibility of a
sinister motive for the unbeliever brings up the equal possibility of a
sinister motive on the part of the convert to Christianity, ancient or
modern. At every turn, then, the charge of perversity of the will
recoils on the advocate of belief; so that it would be the course of
common prudence to abandon it, even were it not in itself, as a rule,
so plainly an expression of irritated bias.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it need not be disputed that unbelief has been
often enough associated with some species of libertinism to give a
passing colour for the pretence of causal connection. The fact,
however, leads us to a less superficial explanation, worth keeping in
view here. Freethinking being taken to be normally a
&ldquo;variation&rdquo; of intellectual type in the direction of a
critical demand for consistency and credibility in beliefs, its social
<i>assertion</i> will be a matter on the one side of force of character
or degree of recklessness, and on the other hand of force of
circumstances. The intellectual potentiality and the propagandist
purpose will be variously developed in different men and in different
surroundings. If we ask ourselves how, in general, the critical
tendency is to arise or to come into play, we are almost compelled to
suppose a special stimulus as well as a special faculty. Critical doubt
is made possible, broadly speaking, by the accumulation of ideas or
habits of certain kinds which insensibly undo a previous state of
homogeneity of thought. For instance, a community subsiding into peace
and order from a state of warfare and plunder will at length find the
ethic of its daily life at variance with the conserved ethic of its
early religion of human sacrifice and special family or tribal
sanctions; or a community which has accumulated a certain amount of
accurate knowledge of astronomy will gradually find such knowledge
irreconcilable with its primitive cosmology. A specially gifted person
will anticipate the general movement of thought; but even for him some
standing-ground must be supposed; and for the majority the advance in
moral practice or scientific knowledge is the condition of any
effective freethinking.</p>
<p>Between top and bottom, however, there are all grades of vivacity,
earnestness, and courage; and on the side of the normal resistance
there are all varieties of political and economic circumstance. It
follows, then, that the <i>avowed</i> freethinker may be so in virtue
either of special courage or of antecedent circumstances which make the
attitude on his part less courageous. And it may even be granted to the
quietist that the courage is at times that of ill-balanced judgment or
heady temperament; just as it may be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>conceded to the
conservative that it is at times that which goes with or follows on
disregard of wise ways of life. It is well that the full force of this
position be realized at the outset. When we find, as we shall, some
historic freethinkers displaying either extreme imprudence or personal
indiscipline, we shall be prepared, in terms of this preliminary
questioning, to realize anew that humanity has owed a great deal to
some of its &ldquo;unbalanced&rdquo; types; and that, though discipline
is nearly the last word of wisdom, indiscipline may at times be the
morbid accompaniment or excess of a certain openness of view and
spontaneity of action which are more favourable to moral and
intellectual advance than a cold prudence or a safe
insusceptibility.</p>
<p>But cold or calm prudence in turn is not a vice; and it is hardly
possible to doubt that there have been in all ages varying numbers of
unbelievers who shrugged their shoulders over the follies of faith, and
declined to tilt against the windmills of fanaticism. There is much
reason for surmising that Shakespeare was a case in point. It is not to
be supposed, then, because some freethinkers who came out into the open
were unbalanced types, that their psychology is <i>the</i> psychology
of freethought, any more than that of General Gordon or Francis of
Assisi is to be reckoned typical on the side of belief. There must have
been myriads of quiet unbelievers, rational all round, whose unbelief
was a strictly intellectual process, undisturbed by temperament. In our
own day such types abound, and it is rather in them than in the
abnormal types of past freethought&mdash;the Brunos and the
Voltaires&mdash;that the average psychology of freethought is to be
looked for and understood.</p>
<p>As for the case of the man who, already at odds with his fellows in
the matter of his conduct, may in some phases of society feel it the
easier to brave them in the matter of his avowed creed, we have already
seen that even this does not convict him of intellectual dishonesty.
And were such cases relatively as numerous as they are
scarce&mdash;were the debauched deists even commoner than the vinous
Steeles and Fieldings&mdash;the use of the fact as an argument would
still be an oblique course on the side of a religion which claims to
have found its first and readiest hearing among publicans and sinners.
For the rest, the harm done in the world&rsquo;s history by unbalanced
freethinkers is as dust in the balance against the immeasurable evil
deliberately wrought on serious religious motives, to say nothing of
the constant deviation of the mass of believers from their own
professed code.</p>
<p>It may, finally, help a religious reader to a judicial view of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>phenomenon of freethought if he is reminded that
every step forward in the alleged historic evolution of his own creed
would depend, in the case put, on the existence of persons capable of
rejecting a current and prevailing code in favour of one either
denounced as impious or marked off by circumstances as dangerous. The
Israelites in Egypt, the prophets and their supporters, the Gospel
Jesus and his adherents, all ostensibly stand in some degree for
positions of &ldquo;negation,&rdquo; of hardy innovation, of disregard
to things and persons popularly venerated; wherefore Collins, in the
<i>Discourse</i> above mentioned, smilingly claimed at least the
prophets as great freethinkers. On that head it may suffice to say that
some of the temperamental qualifications would probably be very much
the same for those who of old brought about religious innovation in
terms of supernatural beliefs, and for those who in later times
innovate by way of minimizing or repudiating such beliefs, though the
intellectual qualifications might be different. Bruno and Dolet and
Vanini and Voltaire, faulty men all four, could at least be more
readily conceived as prophets in early Jewry, or reformers under Herod,
than as Pharisees, or even Sadducees, under either regimen.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, however, the issues between freethought and creed
are ultimately to be settled only in respect of their argumentative
bases, as appreciable by men in society at any given time. It is with
the notion of making the process of judicial appreciation a little
easier, by historically exhibiting the varying conditions under which
it has been undertaken in the past, that these pages are written.

<p class="first">To consider the normal aspects of primitive life, as
we see them in savage communities and trace them in early literature,
is to realize the enormous hindrance offered to critical thinking in
the primary stages of culture by the mere force of habit. &ldquo;The
savage,&rdquo; says our leading anthropologist, &ldquo;by no means goes
through life with the intention of gathering more knowledge and framing
better laws than his fathers. On the contrary, his tendency is to
consider his ancestors as having handed down to him the perfection of
wisdom, which it would be impiety to make the least alteration in.
Hence among the lower races there is obstinate resistance to the most
desirable reforms, and progress can only force its way with a slowness
and difficulty which we of this century can hardly
imagine.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2193src" href="#xd25e2193"
name="xd25e2193src">1</a> Among the Bantu of South Africa, before the
spread of European rule, &ldquo;any person in advance of his fellows
was specially liable to suspicion [of sorcery], so that progress of any
kind towards what we should term higher civilization was made
exceedingly difficult by this belief.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2205src" href="#xd25e2205" name="xd25e2205src">2</a> The real or
would-be sorcerer could thus secure the elimination of the honest
inventor; fear of sorcery being most potent as against the supposed
irregular practitioner. The relative obstinacy of conservatism in
periods and places of narrow knowledge is again illustrated in
Lane&rsquo;s account of the modern Egyptians in the first half of the
nineteenth century: &ldquo;Some Egyptians who had studied for a few
years in France declared to me that they could not instil any of the
notions which they had there acquired even into the minds of their most
intimate friends.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2214src" href=
"#xd25e2214" name="xd25e2214src">3</a> So in modern Japan there were
many assassinations of reformers, and some civil war, before Western
ideas could gain a footing.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2222src" href=

<p>It is hardly possible to estimate with any confidence the relative
rates of progress; but, though all are extremely slow, it would seem
that reason could sooner play correctively on errors of secular
practice<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2230src" href="#xd25e2230" name=
"xd25e2230src">5</a> than on any species of proposition in
religion&mdash;taking that word to connote at once mythology, early
cosmology, and ritual ethic. Mere disbelief in a particular
medicine-man or rain-maker who failed would not lead to any reflective
disbelief in all; any more than the beating or renunciation of his
fetish by a savage or barbarian means rejection of his fetishism, or
than the renunciation of a particular saint by a modern
Catholic<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2239src" href="#xd25e2239" name=

intercession.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The question as to whether savages <i>do</i> beat
their idols is a matter in some dispute. Sir A. B. Ellis, a high
authority, offers a notable denial to the current belief that negroes
&ldquo;beat their Gods if their prayers are unanswered.&rdquo;
&ldquo;After an experience of the Gold Coast extending over thirteen
years,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I have never heard of, much less
witnessed, anything of the kind, although I have made inquiries in
every direction&rdquo; (<i>The Tshi-speaking Peoples</i>, 1887, p.
194). Other anthropologists have collected many instances in other
races&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Fr. Schultze, <i lang="de">Der
Fetischismus</i>, 1871, p. 130. In one case, a priest beats a fetish in
advance, to secure his careful attention. (<i>Id.</i> pp. 90&ndash;91,
citing the personal narrative of Bastian.) It seems to be a matter of
psychic stage. The more primitive negro is as it were too religious,
too much afraid of his Gods, who are not for him &ldquo;idols,&rdquo;
but spirits residing in images or objects. Where the state of fear is
only chronic another temper may arise. Among the Bataks of Sumatra
disappointed worshippers often scold a God; and their legends tell of
men who declared war on a deity and shot at him from a mountain.
(Warneck, <i lang="de">Die Religion des Batak</i>, 1909, p. 7. Cp.
<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%202:4-9&amp;version=NRSV">
Gen. ii, 4&ndash;9</a>.) A temper of defiance towards deity has been
noted in an Aryan Kafir of the Hindu-Kush. (Sir G. S. Robertson, <i>The
K&aacute;firs of the Hindu-Kush</i>, 1899, p. 182.) Some peoples go
much further. Among the Polynesians, when a God failed to cure a sick
chief or notable, he &ldquo;was regarded as inexorable, and was usually
banished from the temple and his image destroyed&rdquo; (W. Ellis,
<i>Polynesian Researches</i>, 2nd ed. 1831, i, 350). So among the
Chinese, &ldquo;if the God does not give rain they will threaten and
beat him; sometimes they publicly depose him from the rank <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>of
deity&rdquo; (Frazer, <i>Lectures on the Early History of Kingship</i>,
1905, pp. 98&ndash;101. Cp. Ross, <i>Pansebeia</i>, 4th ed., 1672, p.
80).</p>
<p>There are many analogous phenomena. In old Samoa, in the ritual of
mourning for the dead, the family God was first implored to restore the
deceased, and then fiercely abused and menaced.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2298src" href="#xd25e2298" name="xd25e2298src">7</a> See, too,
the story of the people of Niu&#275; or Savage Island in the South
Pacific, who in the time of a great pestilence, thinking the sickness
was caused by a certain idol, broke it in pieces and threw it away
(Turner, <i>Samoa a Hundred Years Ago</i>, 1884, p. 306). See further
the cases cited by Constant, <i lang="fr">De la religion</i>, 1824,
vol. i, ptie. ii, pp. 32&ndash;34; and by Peschel, <i>The Races of
Man</i>, Eng. tr. 1876, pp. 247&ndash;8, in particular that of Rastus,
the last pagan Lapp in Europe, who quarrelled with his fetish stone for
killing his reindeer in revenge for the withholding of its customary
offering of brandy, and &ldquo;immediately embraced
Christianity.&rdquo; (Compare E. Rae, <i>The White Sea Peninsula</i>,
1881, p. 276.) See again the testimony of Herman Melville in his
<i>Typee</i>, ch. xxiv; and that of T. Williams, <i>Fiji and the
Fijians</i>, ed. 1858, i, 236: &ldquo;Sometimes the natives get angry
with their deities, and abuse and even challenge them to fight.&rdquo;
Herodotos has similar stories of barbarians who defy their own and
other deities (iv, 172, 183, 184). Compare the case of King Rum Bahadur
of Nepaul, who cannonaded his Gods. Spencer, <i>Study of Sociology</i>,
pp. 301&ndash;2. Also the anecdote cited by Spencer (<i>Id.</i> p. 160)
from Sir R. Burton&rsquo;s <i>Goa</i>, p. 167. Here there is no
disbelief, no reflection, but simple resentment. Compare, too, the
amusing story of a blasphemy by Rossini, told by Louis Viardot,
<i lang="fr">Libre Examen</i>, 6e &eacute;d. pp. 166&ndash;67,
<i>note</i>. That threats against the Gods are possible at a
semi-civilized stage is proved by various passages in medieval
literature. Thus in Caxton&rsquo;s <i>Charles the Grete</i>, a
translation from an older French original, Charles is made to say:
&ldquo;O lord God, if ye suffre that Olyver be overcome and that my
ryght at thys tyme be loste and defyled, I make a vowe that al
Crystyante shal be destroyed. I shal not leve in Fraunce chirche ne
monasterye, ymage ne aulter,&rdquo; etc. (Early Eng. Text Soc. rep.
1881, pp. 70&ndash;71.) Such language was probably used by not a few
medieval kings in moments of fury; and there is even record that at the
battle of Dunbar certain of the Scots Presbyterian clergy intimated to
their deity that he would not be their God if he failed them on that
day.</p>
<p>If such flights be reckoned possible for Christian kings and clerics
in the Christian era, there would seem to be no unlikelihood about the
many stories of God-beating and God-defying among contemporary savages,
though so good an observer as Sir A. B. Ellis may not have witnessed
them in the part of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>Africa best known to him. The conclusion
reached by Sir A. B. Ellis is that the negroes of the Gold Coast are
not properly to be described as fetishists. Fetishism, on his view, is
a worship of objects as in themselves endowed with magical power;
whereas the Gold Coast negro ascribes no virtue to the object commonly
called his fetish, regarding it simply as inhabited by a supernatural
power. This writer sees &ldquo;true fetishism&rdquo; in the attitude of
Italian peasants and fishermen who beat and ill-treat their images when
prayers are not answered, and in that of Spaniards who cover the faces
of their images or turn them to the wall when about to do anything
which they think the saint or deity would disapprove of. On this view,
fetishism is a later yet lower stage of religious evolution than that
of the negro. On the other hand, Miss Kingsley takes fetishism to be
the proper name of the attitude of the negro towards particular objects
as divinely inhabited, and represents it as a kind of pantheism
(<i>West African Studies</i>, 2nd ed. 1901, ch. v). And since, by her
definition, &ldquo;Gods of fetish&rdquo; do not necessarily
&ldquo;require a material object to manifest themselves in&rdquo; (p.
96), the term &ldquo;fetish&rdquo; is thus detached from all of its
former meanings. It seems expedient, as a matter of terminology, to let
fetishism mean both object- or image-worship and the belief in the
special inhabiting of objects by deities, with a recognition that the
beliefs may be different stages in an evolution, though, on the other
hand, they are obviously likely to coalesce or concur. In the
&ldquo;Obeah&rdquo; system of the negroes of the West Indies the former
belief in the indwelling spirit has become, or has coalesced with,
belief in the magical powers of the object (Keane, <i>Man, Past and
Present</i>, 1900, p. 57).</p>
<p>As to defiance or contumely towards the Gods, finally, we have the
testimony of the Swiss missionary Junod that the South African Thonga,
whom he studied very closely, have in their ritual &ldquo;a regular
<i>insulting</i> of the Gods.&rdquo; (<i>Life of a South African
Tribe</i>, ii, 1912, p. 384.) Why not? &ldquo;Prayers to the ancestors
&hellip; are &hellip; absolutely devoid of awe&rdquo; (p. 385), though
&ldquo;the ancestor-Gods are certainly the most powerful spiritual
agency acting on man&rsquo;s life&rdquo; (p. 361); and &ldquo;the
spirits of the ancestors are the main objects of religious
worship&rdquo; (p. 344). The Thonga, again, use &ldquo;neither idolatry
nor fetishism,&rdquo; having no &ldquo;idols&rdquo; (p. 388), though
they recognize &ldquo;hidden virtues&rdquo; in plants, animals, and
stones (p. 345). They simply regard their ancestor-Gods very much as
they do their aged people, whom they generally treat with little
consideration. But the dead can do harm, and must therefore be
propitiated&mdash;as savages propitiate, with fear or malice or
derision in their hearts, as the case may be. (Cp. p. 379.) On the
other hand, despite the denial of their &ldquo;fetishism,&rdquo; they
believe that ancestor-Gods may come in the shape of animals; and they
so venerate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>a kind of palladium (made up like a
medicine-man&rsquo;s amulet) as to raise the question whether this kind
of belief is not just that which Miss Kingsley called
&ldquo;fetish.&rdquo; (Junod, pp. 358, 373&ndash;74.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever may be the essence, or the varieties, of fetishism, it is
clear that the beating of idols or threatening of Gods does not amount
to rational doubt concerning the supernatural. Some general approach to
that attitude may perhaps be inferred in the case of an economic revolt
against the burdens of a highly specialized religious system, which may
often have occurred in unwritten history. We shall note a recorded
instance of the kind in connection with the question whether there are
any savage tribes without religion. But it occurs in the somewhat
highly evolved barbarism of pre-Christian Hawaii; and it can set up no
inference as to any development of critical unbelief at lower levels.
In the long stage of lower savagery, then, the only approach to
freethinking that would seriously affect general belief would
presumably be that very credulity which gave foothold to religious
beliefs to begin with. That is to say, without anything in the nature
of general criticism of any story or doctrine, one such might to some
extent supersede another, in virtue of the relative gift of persuasion
or personal weight of the propounders. Up to a certain point persons
with a turn for myth or ritual-making would compete, and might even
call in question each other&rsquo;s honesty, as well as each
other&rsquo;s inspiration.</p>
<p>Since the rise of scientific hierology there has been a disposition
among students to take for granted the good faith of all early
religion-makers, and to dismiss entirely that assumption of fraud which
was so long made by Christian writers concerning the greater part of
every non-Christian system. The assumption had been passed on from the
freethinkers of antiquity who formulated the view that all religious
doctrine had been invented by politicians in order to control the
people.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2367src" href="#xd25e2367" name=
"xd25e2367src">8</a> Christian polemists, of course, applied it to all
systems but their own. When, however, all systems are seen to be alike
natural in origin, such charges are felt to recoil on the system which
makes them; and latterly<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2385src" href=
"#xd25e2385" name="xd25e2385src">9</a> Christian writers, seeing as
much, have been fain to abandon the conception of
&ldquo;priestcraft,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href=
"#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>adroitly representing it as an
extravagance of rationalism. It certainly served rationalistic
purposes, and the title of the supposititious medieval work on
&ldquo;The Three Impostors&rdquo; points to its currency among
unbelievers long ago; but when we first find it popularly current in
the seventeenth century, it is in a Christian atmosphere.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2402src" href="#xd25e2402" name=
"xd25e2402src">10</a> Some of the early deists and others have probably
in turn exaggerated the amount of deliberate deceit involved in the
formation of religious systems; but nevertheless
&ldquo;priestcraft&rdquo; is a demonstrable factor in the process. What
is called the psychology of religion has been much obscured in response
to the demand of religious persons to have it so presented as to
flatter them in that capacity.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2410src"
href="#xd25e2410" name="xd25e2410src">11</a> Such a claim cannot be
permitted to overrule the fair inductions of comparative science.</p>
<p>Anthropological evidence suggests that, while religion clearly
begins in primordial fear and fancy, wilful fraud must to some extent
have entered into all religious systems alike, even in the period of
primeval credulity, were it only because the credulity was so great.
One of the most judicial and sympathetic of the Christian scholars who
have written the history of Greece treats as unquestionable the view
that alike in pagan and Christian cults &ldquo;priestcraft&rdquo; has
been &ldquo;fertile in profitable devices, in the invention of legends,
the fabrication of relics, and other modes of
imposture&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2421src" href="#xd25e2421"
name="xd25e2421src">12</a> and the leading hierologist of the last
generation pronounces decisively as to an element of intentional deceit
in the Koran-making of Mohammed<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2430src"
href="#xd25e2430" name="xd25e2430src">13</a>&mdash;a judgment which, if
upheld, can hardly fail to be extended to some portions of all other
sacred books. However that may be, we have positive evidence that
wilful and systematic fraud enters into the doctrine of contemporary
savages, and that among some &ldquo;primitives&rdquo; known myths are
deliberately propounded to the boys and women by the male
adults.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2442src" href="#xd25e2442" name=
"xd25e2442src">14</a> Indeed, the majority of modern travellers among
primitives seem to have regarded their priests and sorcerers in the
mass as conscious deceivers.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2448src" href=
"#xd25e2448" name="xd25e2448src">15</a> If, then, we can point
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>to deliberate imposture alike in the
charm-mongering and myth-mongering of contemporary savages and in the
sacred-book-making of the higher historical systems, it seems
reasonable to hold that conscious deceit, as distinguished from
childlike fabrication, would chronically enter into the tale-making of
primitive men, as into their simpler relations with each other. It is
indeed impossible to conceive how a copious mythology could ever arise
without the play of a kind of imaginativeness that is hardly compatible
with veracity; and it is probably only the exigencies of ecclesiastical
life that cause modern critics still to treat the most deliberate
fabrications and forgeries in the Hebrew sacred books as somehow
produced in a spirit of the deepest concern for truth. An all-round
concern for truth is, in fact, a late intellectual development, the
product of much criticism and much doubt; hence, perhaps, the lenity of
the verdicts under notice. Certain wild tribes here and there, living
in a state of great simplicity, are in our own day described as
remarkably truthful;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2486src" href=
"#xd25e2486" name="xd25e2486src">16</a> but they are not remarkable for
range of supernatural belief; and their truthfulness is to be regarded
as a product of their special stability and simplicity of life. The
trickery of a primitive medicine-man, of course, is a much more
childlike thing than the frauds of educated priesthoods; and it is
compatible with so much of spontaneous pietism as is implied in the
common passing of the operator into the state of convulsion and
trance&mdash;a transition which comes easily to many savages.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2495src" href="#xd25e2495" name=
"xd25e2495src">17</a> But even at that stage of psychosis, and in a
community where simple secular lying is very rare, the professional

<p>It belongs, in short, to the very nature of the priestly function,
in its earlier forms, to develop in a special degree the normal bias of
the undisciplined mind to <i>intellectual</i> fraud. Granting that
there are all degrees of self-consciousness in the process, we are
bound to recognize that in all of us there is &ldquo;the sophist
within,&rdquo; who stands between us and candour in every problem
either of self-criticism or of self-defence. And, if the instructed man
recognizes this clearly and the uninstructed does not, none the less is
the latter an exemplification of the fact. His mental obliquities are
not any less real because of his indifference to them than are the

"pb29">29</a>]</span>acts of the hereditary thief because he does them
without shame. And if we consider how the fetish-priest is at every
turn tempted to invent and prevaricate, simply because his pretensions
are fundamentally preposterous; and how in turn the priest of a higher
grade, even when he sincerely &ldquo;believes&rdquo; in his deity, is
bound to put forward as matters of knowledge or revelation the
hypotheses he frames to account for either the acts or the abstentions
of the God, we shall see that the priestly office is really as
incompatible with a high sincerity in the primitive stages as in those
in which it is held by men who consciously propound falsities, whether
for their mere gain or in the hope of doing good. It may be true that
the priestly claim of supernatural sanction for an ethical command is
at times motived by an intense conviction of the rightness of the
course of conduct prescribed; but none the less is such a habit of mind
fatal to intellectual sincerity. Either there is sheer hallucination or
there is pious fraud.</p>
<p>Given, however, the tendency to deceit among primitive folk,
distrust and detection in a certain number of cases would presumably
follow, constituting a measure of simple skepticism. By force partly of
this and partly of sheer instability of thought, early belief would be
apt to subsist for ages like that of contemporary African
tribes,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2513src" href="#xd25e2513" name=
"xd25e2513src">19</a> in a state of flux.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2516src" href="#xd25e2516" name="xd25e2516src">20</a> Comparative
fixity would presumably arise with the approach to stability of life,
of industry, and of political institutions, whether with or without a
special priesthood. The usages of early family worship would seem to
have been no less rigid than those of the tribal and public cults. For
primitive man as for the moderns definite organization and ritual
custom must have been a great establishing force as regards every phase
of religious belief;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2530src" href=
"#xd25e2530" name="xd25e2530src">21</a> and it may well have been that
there was thus less intellectual liberty of a kind in the long ages of
what we regard as primitive civilization than in those of savagery and
barbarism which preceded them. On that view, systems which are supposed
to represent in the fullest degree the primeval spontaneity of religion
may have been in part priestly reactions against habits of freedom
accompanied by a certain amount of skepticism. A modern
inquirer<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2539src" href="#xd25e2539" name=
"xd25e2539src">22</a> has in some such sense advanced the theory that
in ancient India, in even the earlier period of collection of the
Rig-Veda, which itself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"
name="pb30">30</a>]</span>undermined the monarchic character of the
pre-Vedic religion, there was a decay of belief, which the final
redaction served to accelerate. Such a theory can hardly pass beyond
the stage of hypothesis in view of the entire absence of history proper
in early Indian literature; but we seem at least to have the evidence
of the Veda itself that while it was being collected there were deniers
of the existence of its Gods.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2548src" href=

<p>The latter testimony alone may serve as ground for raising afresh an
old question which recent anthropology has somewhat inexactly
decided&mdash;that, namely, as to whether there are any savages without
religious beliefs.</p>

<p>The Rev. H. A. Junod (<i>Life of a South African Tribe</i>, vol. ii,
1913, p. 346) shows how easily misconception on the subject may arise.
Galton (<i>Narrative of an Explorer</i>, ch. viii, ed. 1891, p. 138)
writes: &ldquo;I have no conception to this day whether or no the
Ovampo have any religion, for Click was frightened and angry if the
subject of death was alluded to.&rdquo; The context shows that the
native regarded all questions on religious matters with suspicion.
Schweinfurth, again, contradicts himself twice within three pages as to
the beliefs of the Bongo in a &ldquo;Supreme Being&rdquo; and in a
future state; and thus leaves us doubting his statement that the
neighbouring race, the Dyoor, &ldquo;put no faith at all in any
witchcraft&rdquo; (<i>The Heart of Africa</i>, 3rd ed. i,
143&ndash;45). Much of the confusion turns on the fact that savages who
practise no <i>worship</i> have religious beliefs (cp. Max M&uuml;ller,
Hibbert Lectures, ed. 1878, p. 17, citing Monsignor Salvado; and Carl
Lumholtz, <i>Among Cannibals</i>, 1889, p. 284). The dispute, as it now
stands, mainly turns on the definition of religion (cp. Chantepie de la
Saussaye, <i>Manual of the Science of Religion</i>, Eng. tr. 1891, pp.
16&ndash;18, where Lubbock&rsquo;s position is partly misunderstood).
Dr. Tylor, while deciding that no tribes known to us are religionless,
leaves open the question of their existence in the past.</p>
<p>A notable example of the prolongation of error on this subject
through orthodox assumptions is seen in Dr. A. W. Howitt&rsquo;s
otherwise valuable work on <i>The Native Tribes of South Australia</i>
(1904). Dr. Howitt produces (pp. 488&ndash;508) abundant evidence to
show that a number of tribes believe in a &ldquo;supernatural
anthropomorphic being,&rdquo; variously named Nurrundere, Nurelli,
Bunjil, Mungan-ngaua, Daramalun, and Baiame (&ldquo;<i>the same
being</i> under different names,&rdquo; writes Dr. Howitt, p. 499).
This being he describes as &ldquo;the tribal All-Father,&rdquo;
&ldquo;a venerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32"
name="pb32">32</a>]</span>kindly Headman of a tribe, full of knowledge
and tribal wisdom, and all-powerful in magic, of which he is the
source, with virtues, failings, and passions such as the aborigines
regard them&rdquo; (pp. 500&ndash;1). But he insists (p. 506) that
&ldquo;in this being, though supernatural, there is no trace of a
divine nature,&rdquo; and, again, that &ldquo;the Australian aborigines
do not recognize any divinity, good or evil&rdquo; (p. 756), though (p.
501) &ldquo;it is most difficult for one of us to divest himself of the
tendency to endow such a supernatural being [as the All-Father] with a
nature quasi-divine, if not altogether so.&rdquo; Dr. Howitt does not
name any European deity who satisfies him on the point of divinity!
Obviously the Australian deities have evolved in exactly the same way
as those of other peoples, Yahweh included. Dr. Howitt, indeed, admits
(p. 507) that the Australian notions &ldquo;may have been at the root
of monotheistic beliefs.&rdquo; They certainly were; and when he adds
that, &ldquo;although it cannot be alleged that these aborigines have
<i>consciously any form of religion</i>, it may be said that their
beliefs are such that, under favourable conditions, they <i>might
have</i> developed into an <i>actual religion</i>,&rdquo; he indicates
afresh the confusion possible from unscientific definitions. The sole
content of his thesis is, finally, that a &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo;
being is not &ldquo;divine&rdquo; till the priests have somewhat
trimmed him, and that a religion is not &ldquo;actual&rdquo; till it
has been sacerdotally formulated. Dr. Howitt&rsquo;s negations are as
untenable as Mr. Andrew Lang&rsquo;s magnification of the Australian
All-Father into a perfect Supreme Being.</p>
<p>The really important part of Dr. Howitt&rsquo;s survey of the
problem is his conclusion that the kind of belief he has described
exists only in a specified area of Australia, and that this area is
&ldquo;the habitat of tribes &hellip; where there has been the advance
from group marriage to individual marriage, from descent in the female
line to that in the male line&rdquo; (p. 500). Messrs. Spencer and
Gillen&rsquo;s denial of the existence of any belief in a personal
deity among the tribes of Central Australia (<i>Northern Tribes</i>,
1904, p. 491) appears to stand for actual fact.</p>
<p>As to the &ldquo;divinity&rdquo; of the ancestor-gods of the
primitives, see <i>Pagan Christs</i>, 2nd ed. p. 41 <i>sq.</i>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem has been unduly narrowed to the question whether there
are any whole tribes so developed. It is obviously pertinent to ask
whether there may not be diversity of opinion within a given tribe.
Such testimonies as those collected by Sir John Lubbock [Lord Avebury]
and others, as to the existence of religionless savages, are held to be
disposed of by further proof that tribes of savages who had been set
down as religionless on the evidence of some of themselves had in
reality a number of religious beliefs. Travellers&rsquo; questions had
been falsely answered, either on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>principle that
non-initiates must not be told the mysteries, or from that sudden
perception of the oddity of their beliefs which comes even to some
civilized people when they try to state them to an unbelieving
outsider. Questions, again, could easily be misunderstood, and answers
likewise. We find, for instance, that savages who scout the idea that
the dead can &ldquo;rise again&rdquo; do believe in the continued
disembodied existence of all their dead, and even at times conceive of
them as marrying and procreating! On the whole, they conceive of a
continuity of spirit-life on earth in human shape. To speak of such
people as having no idea of &ldquo;a life beyond the grave&rdquo; would
obviously be misleading, though they have no notion of a judgment day
or of future rewards or punishments.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2726src" href="#xd25e2726" name="xd25e2726src">24</a></p>
<p>Undoubtedly, then, the negative view of savage religion had in a
number of cases been hastily taken; but there remains the question, as
a rule surprisingly ignored, whether some of the savages who disavowed
all belief in things supernatural may not have been telling the simple
truth about themselves, or even about their families and their
comrades. As one sympathetic traveller notes of the Samoyedes:
&ldquo;There can be no such thing as strict accuracy of grammar or
expression among an illiterate people; nor can there be among these
simple creatures any consistent or fixed appreciation even of their own
forms of &hellip; belief&#8202;&hellip;. Having no object in arriving
at a common view of such matters, each Samoyede, if questioned
separately, will give more or less his own disconnected impression of
his faith.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2732src" href="#xd25e2732"
name="xd25e2732src">25</a> And this holds of unfaith. A savage asked by
a traveller, &ldquo;Do you believe&rdquo; so-and-so, might very well
give a true negative answer for himself;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2738src" href="#xd25e2738" name="xd25e2738src">26</a> and the
traveller&rsquo;s resulting misconception would be due to his own
arbitrary assumption that all members of any tribe must think
alike.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A good witness expressly testifies: &ldquo;In the
tribe [of Australians] with which I was best acquainted, while the
blacks had a term for ghost and believed that there were departed
spirits who were sometimes to be seen among the foliage, individual men
would tell you upon inquiry that they believed that death was the last
of them&rdquo; (<i>Eaglehawk and Crow: A Study of the Australian
Aborigines</i>, by John Mathew, M.A., B.D., 1899, p. 146). As to the
<i>risk</i> of wrong negative inferences, on the other hand, see pp.
145, 147. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>One of the best of our missionary witnesses, H. A. Junod, in his
valuable study of the South African Thonga, testifies both to the
commonness of individual variation in the way of religious fancy and
the occurrence of sporadic unbelief, usually ended by fear. Individuals
freely indulge in concrete speculations&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, as to the
existence of animal souls&mdash;which do not win vogue (<i>Life of a
South African Tribe</i>, vol. ii, 1913, p. 342 <i>sq.</i>), though the
reporter seems to overlook the possibility that such ideas <i>may</i>
be adopted by a tribe. Freethinking ideas have, of course, by far the
least chance of currency. &ldquo;The young folks of Libombo used to
blaspheme in their hearts, saying, &lsquo;There are no Gods.&rsquo;
But,&rdquo; added the witness, &ldquo;we very soon saw that there were
some, when they killed one of us,&rdquo; who trod on a snake (work
cited, pp. 354&ndash;55). That testimony illustrates well the
difficulties of rational progress in a primitive community. But at
times the process may be encouraged by the environment. The early
missionary Ellis gives an instance of a community in Hawaii that had
abandoned all religious practices: &ldquo;We asked them who was their
God. They said they had no God; formerly they had many: but now they
had cast them all away. We asked them if they had done well in
abolishing them. They said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; for tabu had occasioned
much labour and inconvenience, and drained off the best of their
property. We asked them if it was a good thing to have no
God&#8202;&hellip;. They said perhaps it was; for they had nothing to
provide for the great sacrifices, and were under no fear of punishment
for breaking tabu; that now one fire cooked their food, and men and
women ate together the same kind of provisions.&rdquo; (W. Ellis,
<i>Tour Through Hawaii or Owhyhee</i>, 1827, p. 100.) The community in
question had in their own way reached the Lucretian verdict, <i lang=
"la">Tantum relligio potuit suadere malorum</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless, again, such witnesses as Moffat be unfaithful reporters as
well as mistaken in their inferences, <i>some</i> of the natives with
whom they dealt were all but devoid of the ordinary religious
notions<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2781src" href="#xd25e2781" name=
"xd25e2781src">27</a> which in the case of other natives have enabled
the missionaries to plant their doctrines. Nor is there anything hard
of belief in the idea that, just as special religious movements spread
credence in certain periods, a lack of active teachers in certain
tribes may for a time have let previously common beliefs pass almost
out of knowledge. If it be true that the Black Death wrought a great
decline in the ecclesiastical life of England in the fourteenth
century,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2789src" href="#xd25e2789" name=
"xd25e2789src">28</a> a long period of life-destroying conditions might
eliminate from the life of a savage tribe all lore save that of primary
self-preservation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"

fact that rain-makers in his time were usually foreigners to the tribes

times of scarcity, and killed them; and as one after the other was
killed, the end of it was that no one wished to be

state of things religion might well lose vogue.</p>

priests, despite their power and prestige, are always under suspicion
by reason of their frequent miscarriages; and they are&mdash;or
were&mdash;not unfrequently put to death.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2855src" href="#xd25e2855" name="xd25e2855src">36</a> Here there
is disbelief in the priest without disbelief in the God. But a
disbelief in the priest which tended to exterminate him might well
diminish religion.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a relative indifference to religion in a given
tribe might result from the influence of one or more leading men who
spontaneously doubted the religious doctrine offered to them, as many
in Israel, on the face of the priestly records, disbelieved in the
whole theocratic polity. In modern times preachers are constantly found
charging &ldquo;unbelief&rdquo; on their own flocks, in respect not of
any criticism of religious narrative or dogma, but of simple lack of
ostensible faith in doctrines of prayer and Providence nominally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=

href="#xd25e2865" name="xd25e2865src">37</a> Among peasants who have
never seen a freethinking book or heard a professed freethinker&rsquo;s
arguments may be heard expressions of spontaneous unfaith in current
doctrines of Providence.</p>
<p>This is but a type of variations possible in primitive societies.
Despite the social potency of primitive custom, variation may be
surmised to occur in the mental as in the physical life at all stages;
and what normally happens in savagery and low civilization appears to
be a cancelment of the skeptical variation by the total
circumstances&mdash;the strength of the general lead to
supernaturalism, the plausibility of such beliefs to the average
intelligence, and the impossibility of setting up skeptical
institutions to oppose the others. In civilized ages skeptical
movements are repeatedly seen to dwindle for simple lack of
institutions; which, however, are spontaneously set up by and serve as
sustainers of religious systems. On the simpler level of savagery,
skeptical personalities would in the long run fail to affirm themselves
as against the institutions of ordinary savage religion&mdash;the
seasonal feasts, the ceremonies attending birth and death, the use of
rituals, images, charms, sorcery, all tending to stimulate and conserve
supernatural beliefs in general. Only the abnormally courageous would
dare outspokenly to doubt or deny at all; and their daring would put
them in special jeopardy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2872src" href=
"#xd25e2872" name="xd25e2872src">38</a> The ancient maxim, <i lang=

<p>The check to intellectual evolution would here be on all fours with
some of the checks inferribly at work in early moral evolution, where
the types with the higher ideals would seem often to be positively
endangered by their peculiarity, and would thus be the less likely to
multiply. And what happened as between man and man would further tend
to happen at times as between communities. Given the possible case of a
tribe so well placed as to be unusually little affected by fear of
enemies and the natural forces, the influence of rationalistic chiefs
or of respected tribesmen might set up for a time a considerable
anti-religious variation, involving at least a minimizing of religious
doctrine and practices. Such a case is actually seen among the
prosperous peoples of the Upper Congo, some of whom, like the poorer
tribes known to Moffat, have no &ldquo;medicine-men&rdquo; of their
own, and very vague notions of deity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2912src" href="#xd25e2912" name="xd25e2912src">42</a> But when
such a tribe did chance to come into conflict with others more
religious, it would be peculiarly obnoxious to them; and, being in the
terms of the case unwarlike, its chance of survival on the old lines
would be small.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Such a possibility is suggested with some vividness by
the familiar contrast between the modern communities of Fiji and
Samoa&mdash;the former cruel, cannibalistic, and religious, the latter
much less austerely religious and much more humane. The ferocious
Fijians &ldquo;looked upon the Samoans with horror, because they had no
religion, no belief in any such deities [as the Fijians&rsquo;], nor
any of the sanguinary rites which prevailed in other islands&rdquo;
(Spencer, <i>Study of Sociology</i>, pp. 293&ndash;94, following J.
Williams, <i>Narrative of Missionary Enterprise in the South Sea
Islands</i>, ed. 1837, pp. 540&ndash;41; cp. the Rev. A. W. Murray,
<i>Forty Years&rsquo; Mission Work</i>, 1876, p. 171). The &ldquo;no
religion&rdquo; is, of course, only relatively true. Mr. Lang has
noticed the error of the phrase &ldquo;the godless Samoans&rdquo; (cp.
Turner, <i>Samoa a Hundred Years Ago</i>, 1884, pp. 16&ndash;17); but,
while suggesting that the facts are the other way, he admits that in
their creed &ldquo;the religious sentiment has already become more or
less self-conscious, and has begun to reason on its own
practices&rdquo; (<i>Myth, Ritual, and Religion</i>, ii, 34; 2nd ed.,
ii, 58).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking the phenomena all along the line of evolution, we are led to
the generalization that the rationalistic tendency, early or late, like
the religious tendency, is a variation which prospers at different
times in different degrees relatively to the favourableness of the
environment. This view will be set forth in some detail in the course
of our history. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=

<p>It is not, finally, a mere surmise that individual savages and
semi-savages in our own time vary towards disbelief in the
supernaturalism of their fellows. To say nothing of the rational
skepticism exhibited by the Zulu converts of Bishop Colenso, which was
the means of opening his eyes to the incredibility of the
Pentateuch,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2942src" href="#xd25e2942" name=

state,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2948src" href="#xd25e2948" name=
"xd25e2948src">44</a> we have the express missionary record that the
forcible suppression of idolatry and tabu and the priesthood by King
Rihoriho in the island of Hawaii, in 1819, was accomplished not only
&ldquo;before the arrival of any missionary,&rdquo; but on purely
common-sense grounds, and with no thought of furthering Christianity,
though he had heard of the substitution of Christianity for the native
religion by Pomare in Tahiti. Rihoriho simply desired to save his wives
and other women from the cruel pressure of the tabu system, and to
divert the priests&rsquo; revenues to secular purposes; and he actually
had some strong priestly support.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2954src"
href="#xd25e2954" name="xd25e2954src">45</a> Had not the missionary
system soon followed, however, the old worship, which had been
desperately defended in battle at the instigation of the conservative
priests, would in all probability have grown up afresh, though perhaps
with modifications. The savage and semi-savage social conditions, taken
as a whole, are fatally unpropitious to rationalism.</p>
<p>A parallel case to that of Rihoriho is that of King Finow of the
Tonga Islands, described by Mariner, who was his intimate. Finow was
noted for his want of religion. &ldquo;He used to say that the Gods
would always favour that party in war in which there were the greatest
chiefs and warriors&rdquo;&mdash;the European <i>mot</i> strictly
adapted to Fiji conditions. &ldquo;He did not believe that the Gods
paid much attention in <i>other</i> respects to the affairs of mankind;
nor did he think that they could have any reason for doing so&mdash;no
more than men could have any reason or interest in attending to the
affairs of the Gods.&rdquo; For the rest, &ldquo;it is certain that he
disbelieved most of the oracles delivered by the priests,&rdquo; though
he carefully used them for political and military purposes; and he
acquiesced in the usage of human sacrifices&mdash;particularly on his
own account&mdash;while professing to deplore the taste of the Gods in
these matters. His own death seems to have been the result of poisoning
by a priest, whom the king had planned to strangle. The king&rsquo;s
daughter was sick, and the priest, instead of bringing about her
recovery by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>prayers, hardily explained that the illness was
the act of the Gods in punishment of the king&rsquo;s frequent
disrespect to them. Daughter and father were alternately ill, till the
former died; and then it was that the king, by disclosing his resolve
to strangle the priest, brought on his own death (1810). A few warriors
were disposed to take revenge on the priest; but the majority, on
learning the facts, shuddered at the impious design of the late king,
and regarded his death as the natural vengeance of the Gods. But,
though such &ldquo;impiety&rdquo; as his was very rare, his son after
him decided to abolish the priestly office of &ldquo;divine
chieftain,&rdquo; on the score that it was seen to avail for nothing,
while it cost a good deal; and the chiefs and common people were soon
brought to acquiesce in the policy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2970src"
href="#xd25e2970" name="xd25e2970src">46</a></p>
<p>Such cases appear to occur in many barbarous communities. It is
recorded of the Kaffir chief Go that he was perfectly aware of the
hollowness of the pretensions of the magicians and rain-makers of his
tribe, though he held it impolitic to break with them, and called them
in and followed their prescriptions, as did his subjects.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e2977src" href="#xd25e2977" name=
"xd25e2977src">47</a> Of the Galeka chief Segidi it is similarly told
that, while his medicine-men went into trances for occult knowledge
preparatory to a military expedition, he carefully obtained real
information through spies, and, while liberally rewarding his wizards,
sent his sons to school at Blythswood.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e2986src" href="#xd25e2986" name="xd25e2986src">48</a> Yet again,
in Bede&rsquo;s <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, we have the story of
King Edwin&rsquo;s priest, Coifi, na&iuml;vely avowing that he saw no
virtue in his religion,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2995src" href=
"#xd25e2995" name="xd25e2995src">49</a> inasmuch as many men received
more royal favours than he, who had been most diligent in serving the
Gods.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3001src" href="#xd25e3001" name=
"xd25e3001src">50</a> Such a declaration might very well have been
arranged for by the Christian Bishop Paulinus, who was converting the
king, and would naturally provide for Coifi; but on any view a process
of skepticism had taken place in the barbarian&rsquo;s mind.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3008src" href="#xd25e3008" name=

<p>Other illustrations come from the history of ancient Scandinavia.
Grimm notes in several Norse sagas and songs expressions of contempt
for various Gods, which appear to be independent of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>Christian influence;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3022src" href="#xd25e3022" name="xd25e3022src">52</a> and many
warriors continued alike the Christian and the Pagan deities. In the
saga of King Olaf Tryggvason, who enforced Christianity on Norway, it
is declared by one chief that he relied much more on his own arm than
on Thor and Odin; while another announced that he was neither Christian
nor Pagan, adding: &ldquo;My companions and I have no other religion
than the confidence of our own strength and in the good success which
always attends us in war.&rdquo; Similar sentiments are recorded to
have been uttered by Rolf Krake, a legendary king of Denmark
(<i>circa</i> 500);<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3030src" href=
"#xd25e3030" name="xd25e3030src">53</a> and we have in the
<i>&AElig;neid</i> the classic type&mdash;doubtless drawn from barbaric
life&mdash;of Mezentius, <i lang="la">divum contemptor</i>, who calls
his right arm his God, and in dying declares that he appeals to no
deity.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3055src" href="#xd25e3055" name=
"xd25e3055src">54</a> Such utterances, indeed, do not amount to
rational freethinking; but, where some could be thus capable of
anti-theism, it is reasonable to surmise that among the more reflective
there were some capable of simple atheism or non-belief, and of the
prudence of keeping the fact to themselves. Partial skepticism, of
course, would be much more common, as among the Aryan Kafirs of the
Hindu-Kush, with whom, before their conquest by the Ameer of
Afghanistan, a British agent found among the younger men an inclination
to be skeptical about some sacred ceremonies, while very sincere in
their worship of their favourite deity, the God of war.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3060src" href="#xd25e3060" name=
"xd25e3060src">55</a></p>
<p>It is thus seen to be inaccurate to say, as has been said by an
accomplished antagonist of apriorism, that &ldquo;under the yoke of
tribal custom skepticism can hardly arise: there is no place for the
half-hearted: as all men feel alike, so all think alike: skepticism
arises when beliefs are put into formal propositions.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3068src" href="#xd25e3068" name=
"xd25e3068src">56</a> It is broadly true that &ldquo;there is no place
for&rdquo; the doubter as such in the tribal society; but doubters do
exist. Skepticism&mdash;in the sense in which the term is here used,
that of rational disbelief&mdash;may even be commoner in some stages of
the life of tribal customs than in some stages of backward civilization
loaded with formulated creeds. What is true is that in the primitive
life the rationalism necessarily fails, for lack of culture and
institutions, to diffuse and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>establish itself, whereas
superstition succeeds, being naturally institution-making. Under such
conditions skepticism is but a recurrent variation.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3076src" href="#xd25e3076" name="xd25e3076src">57</a></p>
<p>It is significant, further, that in the foregoing cases of unbelief
at the lower levels of civilization it is only the high rank of the
doubter that secures publication for the fact of the doubt. In Hawaii,
or Tonga, only a king&rsquo;s unbelief could make itself historically
heard. So in the familiar story of the doubting Inca of Peru, who in
public religious assembly is said to have avowed his conclusion that
the deified Sun was not really a living thing, it is the status of the
speaker that gives his words a record. The doubt had in all likelihood
been long current among the wise men of Peru; it is indeed ascribed to
two or three different Incas;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3084src" href=
"#xd25e3084" name="xd25e3084src">58</a> but, save for the Incas&rsquo;
promulgation of it, history would bear no trace of Peruvian skepticism.
So again in the Acolhuan State of Tezcuco, the most civilized in the
New World before the Spanish conquest, the great King Netzahualcoyotl
is found opposing the cults of human sacrifice and worshipping an
&ldquo;unknown God,&rdquo; without an image and with only incense for
offering.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3087src" href="#xd25e3087" name=
"xd25e3087src">59</a> Only the king in such an environment could put on
record such a conception. There is, in fact, reason to believe that all
ancient ameliorations of bloody rites were the work of humane kings or
chiefs,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3102src" href="#xd25e3102" name=
"xd25e3102src">60</a> as they are known to have been among semi-savages
in our own day.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3111src" href="#xd25e3111"
name="xd25e3111src">61</a> In bare justice we are bound to surmise that
similar developments of rationalism have been fairly frequent in
unwritten history, and that there must have been much of it among the
common folk; though, on the other hand, the very position of a savage
king, and the special energy of character which usually goes to secure
it, may count for much in giving him the courage to think in defiance
of custom. In modern as in early Christian times, it is always to the
chief or king of a savage or barbarous tribe that the missionary looks
for permission to proceed against the force of popular
conservatism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3120src" href="#xd25e3120"
name="xd25e3120src">62</a> Apart from kings and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>chiefs,
the priesthood itself would be the likeliest soil for skepticism,
though, of course, not for the open avowal of it.</p>
<p>There are to be noted, finally, the facts collected as to marked
skeptical variation among children;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3131src"
href="#xd25e3131" name="xd25e3131src">63</a> and the express evidence
that &ldquo;it has not been found in a single instance that an
uneducated deaf-mute has had any conception of the existence of a
Supreme Being as the Creator and Ruler of the Universe.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3137src" href="#xd25e3137" name=
"xd25e3137src">64</a> These latter phenomena do not, of course, entitle
us to accept Professor Gruppe&rsquo;s sweeping theorem that it is the
religious variation that is abnormal, and that religion can have spread
only by way of the hereditary imposition of the original insanity of
one or two on the imagination of the many.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3149src" href="#xd25e3149" name="xd25e3149src">65</a> Deaf-mutes
are not normal organisms. But all the facts together entitle us to
decide that religion, broadly speaking, is but the variation that has
chiefly flourished, by reason of its adaptation to the prevailing
environment thus far; and to reject as unscientific the formulas which,
even in the face of the rapidly-spreading rationalism of the more
civilized nations, still affirm supernaturalist beliefs to be a
universal necessity of the human mind.</p>
<p>On the same grounds, we must reject the claim&mdash;arbitrarily set
up by one historian in the very act of showing how religion
historically oppugns science&mdash;that all sacred books as such
&ldquo;are true because they have been developed in accordance with the
laws governing the evolution of truth in human history; and because in
poem, chronicle, code, legend, myth, apologue, or parable, they reflect
this development of what is best in the onward march of
humanity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3168src" href="#xd25e3168"
name="xd25e3168src">66</a> In this proposition the opening words,
&ldquo;are true <i>because</i>&rdquo; are strictly meaningless. All
literature whatever has been developed under the same general laws. But
if it be meant that sacred books were specially likely to garner truth
as such, the claim must be negated. In terms of the whole demonstration
of the bias of theology against new truth in modern times, the
irresistible presumption is that in earlier times also the theological
and theocratic spirit was in general hostile to every process by which
truth is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>normally attained. And if the thesis be limited to
moral truth, it is still less credible. It is, in fact, inconceivable
that literature so near the popular level as to suit whole priesthoods
should be morally the best of which even the age producing it is
capable; and nothing is more certain than that enlightened ethic has
always had to impeach or explain away the barbarisms of some sacred
books. The true summary is that in all cases the accepted sacred books
have of necessity fallen short not only of scientific truth and of pure
ethic, but even of the best speculation and the best ethic of the time
of their acceptance, inasmuch as they excluded the criticism of the
freethinking few on the sacred books themselves. There is sociological
as well as physical science, and the former is flouted when the whole
freethinking of the human race in the period of Bible-making is either
ignored or treated as worthless.</p>
<p>It is probable, for instance, that in all stages of primitive
religion there have been disbelievers in the value of sacrifice, who
might or might not dare to denounce the practice. The demurrers to it
in the Hebrew prophetic literature are probably late; but they were in
all likelihood anticipated in early times. Among the Fijians, for whom
cannibalism was an essentially religious act, and the privilege of the
males of the aristocracy, there were a number of the latter who, before
and apart from the entrance of Christianity, abominated and denounced
the practice, reasoning against it also on utilitarian grounds, while
the orthodox made it out to be a social duty. There were even whole
towns which revolted against it and made it <i>tabu</i>; and it was by
force mainly of this rationalistic reaction that the missionaries
succeeded so readily in putting down the usage.<a class="noteref" id=

impossible to estimate how often in the past such a revolt of reason

<h3 class="main">&sect; 1. <i>Early Association and Competition of
Cults</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When religion has entered on the stage of
quasi-civilized organization, with fixed legends or documents, temples,
and the rudiments of hierarchies, the increased forces of terrorism and
conservatism are in nearly all cases seen to be in part countervailed
by the simple interaction of the systems of different communities.
There is no more ubiquitous force in the whole history of the subject,
operating as it does in ancient Assyria, in the life of Vedic India and
Confucian China, and in the diverse histories of progressive Greece and
relatively stationary Egypt, down through the Christian Middle Ages to
our own period of comparative studies.</p>
<p>In ages when any dispassionate comparative study was impossible,
religious systems appear to have been considerably modified by the
influence of those of conquered peoples on those of their conquerors,
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Peoples who while at arm&rsquo;s length
would insult and affect to despise each other&rsquo;s Gods, and would
deride each other&rsquo;s myths,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3213src"
href="#xd25e3213" name="xd25e3213src">1</a> appear frequently to have
altered their attitude when one had conquered the other; and this not
because of any special growth of sympathy, but by force of the old
motive of fear. In the stage of natural polytheism no nation really
doubted the existence of the Gods of another; at most, like the Hebrews
of the early historic period, it would set its own God above the
others, calling him &ldquo;Lord of Lords.&rdquo; But, every community
having its own God, he remained a local power even when his own
worshippers were conquered, and his cult and lore were respected
accordingly. This procedure, which has been sometimes attributed to the
Romans in particular as a stroke of political sagacity, was the normal
and natural course of polytheism. Thus in the Hebrew books the Assyrian
conqueror is represented as admitting that it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>necessary to leave a priest who knows &ldquo;the
manner of the God of the land&rdquo; among the new inhabitants he has
planted there.</p>

Mythol.</i>, Eng. trans., p. 193; Adolf Bastian, <i lang="de">Der

F. B. Jevons&rsquo;s <i>Introd. to the Hist. of Relig.</i>, 1896, pp.
36&ndash;40, where the fear felt by conquering races for the occult
powers of the conquered is limited to the sphere of
&ldquo;magic.&rdquo; But when Dr. Jevons so defines magic as to admit
of his proposition (p. 38) that &ldquo;the <i>hostility from the
beginning</i> between religion and magic is universally
admitted,&rdquo; he throws into confusion the whole phenomena of the
early official-religious practice of magic, of which sacrifice and
prayer are the type-forms that have best survived. And in the end he
upsets his definition by noting (p. 40) how magic, &ldquo;<i>even
where</i> its relation to religion is one of avowed hostility,&rdquo;
will imitate religion. Obviously magic is a function or aspect or
element of primitive religion (cp. Roskoff, <i lang="de">Das
Religionswesen der rohesten Naturv&ouml;lker</i>, 1880, p. 144; Sayce,
pp. 315, 319, 327, and <i>passim</i>; and Tiele, <i>Egyptian Rel.</i>,
pp. 22, 32); and any &ldquo;hostility,&rdquo; far from being universal,
is either a social or a philosophical differentiation. On the whole
question compare the author&rsquo;s <i>Pagan Christs</i>, 2nd ed., pp.
11&ndash;38. In the opinion of Weber (<i>Hist. of Ind. Lit.</i>, p.
264) the magic arts &ldquo;found a more and more fruitful soil as the
religious development of the Hindus progressed&rdquo;; &ldquo;so that
they now, in fact, reign almost supreme.&rdquo; See again Dr.
Jevons&rsquo;s own later admission, p. 395, where the exception of
Christianity is somewhat arbitrary. On this compare Kant, <i lang=
"de">Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft</i>, B. iv,
Th. ii, &sect; 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar cases have been noted in primitive cults still surviving.
Fear of the magic powers of &ldquo;lower&rdquo; or conquered races is
in fact normal wherever belief in wizardry survives; and to the general
tendency may be conjecturally ascribed such phenomena as that of the
Saturnalia, in which masters and slaves changed places, and the
institution of the Levites among the Hebrews, otherwise only mythically
explained. But if conquerors and conquered thus tended to amalgamate or
associate their cults, equally would allied tribes tend to do so; and,
when particular Gods of different groups were seen to correspond in
respect of special attributes, a further analysis <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>would be
encouraged. Hence, with every extension of every State, every advance
in intercourse made in peace or through war, there would be a further
comparison of credences, a further challenge to the reasoning powers of
thoughtful men.</p>

a Pakeha Maori&rdquo; (2nd ed. Auckland, 1863, p. 154), of the
believing resort of some white men to native wizards in New
Zealand.</p>
<p>Stevenson, again, is evidently proceeding upon observation when he
makes his trader in <i>The Beach of Fales&agrave;</i> say: &ldquo;We
laugh at the natives and their superstitions; but see how many traders
take them up, splendidly educated white men that have been bookkeepers
(some of them) and clerks in the old country&rdquo; (<i>Island
Nights&rsquo; Entertainments</i>, 1893, pp. 104&ndash;105). In
Abyssinia, &ldquo;Galla sorceresses are frequently called in by the
Christians of Shoa to transfer sickness or to rid the house of evil
spirits&rdquo; (Major W. Cornwallis Harris, <i>The Highlands of
Aethiopia</i>, 1844, iii, 50). On the other hand, some Sudanese tribes
&ldquo;believe in the virtue both of Christian and Moslem amulets, but
have hitherto lent a deaf ear to the preachers of both these
religions&rdquo; (A. H. Keane, <i>Man, Past and Present</i>, 1900, p.
50).</p>
<p>This tendency did not exclude, but would in certain cases conflict
with, the strong primitive tendency to associate every God permanently
with his supposed original locality. Tiele writes (<i>Hist. of the
Egypt. Relig.</i>, Eng. trans. introd. p. xvii) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>that in
no case was a place given to the Gods of one nation in another&rsquo;s
pantheon &ldquo;if they did not wholly alter their form, character,
appearance, and not seldom their very name.&rdquo; This seems an
over-statement, and is inconsistent with Tiele&rsquo;s own statement
(<i lang="fr">Hist. compar&eacute;e des anc. relig. &eacute;gyptiennes
et s&eacute;mitiques</i>, French trans., 1882, pp. 174&ndash;80) as to
the adoption of Sumerian and Akkadian Gods and creeds by the Semites.
What is clear is that local cults resisted the removal of their
Gods&rsquo; images; and the attempt to deport such images to Babylon,
thus affecting the monopoly of the God of Babylon himself, was a main
cause of the fall of Nabonidos, who was driven out by Cyrus. (E. Meyer,
<i lang="de">Geschichte des Alterthums</i>, i (1884), 599.) But the
Assyrians invoked Bel Merodach of Babylon, after they had conquered
Babylon, in terms of his own ritual; even as Israelites often invoked
the Gods of Canaan (cp. Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, <i>Relig. of the Anc.
Babylonians</i>, p. 123). And King Mardouk-nadinakhe of Babylon, in the
twelfth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, carried off statues of
the Assyrian Gods from the town of Hekali to Babylon, where they were
kept captive for 418 years (Maspero, <i lang="fr">Hist. anc. des
peuples de l&rsquo;orient</i>, 4e &eacute;d. p. 300). A God could
migrate with his worshippers from city to city (Meyer, iii, 169; Sayce,
p. 124); and the Assyrian scribe class maintained the worship of their
special God Nebo wherever they went, though he was a local God to start
with (Sayce, pp. 117, 119, 121). And as to the recognition of the Gods
of different Egyptian cities by politic kings, see Tiele&rsquo;s own
statement, p. 36. Cp. his <i>Outlines</i>, pp. 73, 84, 207.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A concrete knowledge of the multiplicity of cults, then, was
obtruded on the leisured and travelled men of the early empires and of
such a civilization as that of Hellas;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3408src" href="#xd25e3408" name="xd25e3408src">2</a> and when to
such knowledge there was added a scientific astronomy (the earliest to
be constituted of the concrete sciences), a revision of beliefs by such
men was inevitable.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3414src" href=
"#xd25e3414" name="xd25e3414src">3</a> It might take the form either of
a guarded skepticism or of a monarchic theology, answering to the
organization of the actual earthly empire; and the latter view, in the
nature of the case, would much the more easily gain ground. The
freethought of early civilization, then, would be practically limited
for a long time to movements in the direction of co-ordinating
polytheism, to the end of setting up a supreme though not a sole deity;
the chief <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>God in any given case being apt to be the God
specially affected by the reigning monarch. Allocation of spheres of
influence to the principal deities would be the working minimum of
plausible adjustment, since only in some such way could the established
principle of the regularity of the heavens be formally accommodated to
the current worship; and wherever there was monarchy, even if the
monarch were polytheistic, there was a lead to gradation among the
Gods.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3428src" href="#xd25e3428" name=
"xd25e3428src">4</a> A pantheistic conception would be the highest
stretch of rationalism that could have any vogue even among the
educated class. All the while every advance was liable to the
ill-fortune of overthrow or arrest at the hands of an invading
barbarism, which even in adopting the system of an established
priesthood would be more likely to stiffen than to develop it. Early
rationalism, in short, would share in the fluctuations of early
civilization; and achievements of thought would repeatedly be swept
away, even as were the achievements of the constructive arts.</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 2. <i>The Process in India</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The process thus deducible from the main conditions is
found actually happening in more than one of the ancient cultures, as
their history is now sketched. In the Rig-Veda, which if not the oldest
is the least altered of the Eastern Sacred Books, the main line of
change is obvious enough. It remains so far matter of conjecture to
what extent the early Vedic cults contain matter adopted from non-Aryan
Asiatic peoples; but no other hypothesis seems to account for the
special development of the cult of Agni in India as compared with the
content and development of the other early Aryan systems, in which,
though there are developments of fire worship, the God Agni does not
appear.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3447src" href="#xd25e3447" name=
"xd25e3447src">5</a> The specially priestly character of the Agni
worship, and the precedence it takes in the Vedas over the solar cult
of Mitra, which among the kindred Aryans of Iran receives in turn a
special development, suggest some such grafting, though the relations
between Aryans and the Hindu aborigines, as indicated in the Veda, seem
to exclude the possibility of their adopting the fire-cult from the
conquered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>inhabitants,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3464src"
href="#xd25e3464" name="xd25e3464src">6</a> who, besides, are often
spoken of in the Vedas as &ldquo;non-sacrificers,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3470src" href="#xd25e3470" name="xd25e3470src">7</a>
and at times as &ldquo;without Gods.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3476src" href="#xd25e3476" name="xd25e3476src">8</a> But this is
sometimes asserted even of hostile Aryans.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3482src" href="#xd25e3482" name="xd25e3482src">9</a> In any case
the carrying on of the two main cults of Agni and Indra side by side
points to an original and marked heterogeneity of racial elements;
while the varying combination with them of the worship of other
deities, the old Aryan Varuna, the three forms of the Sun-God Aditya,
the Goddess Aditi and the eight Adityas, the solar Mitra, Vishnu,
Rudra, and the Maruts, imply the adaptation of further varieties of
hereditary creed. The outcome is a sufficiently chaotic medley, in
which the attributes and status of the various Gods are reducible to no
code,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3488src" href="#xd25e3488" name=
"xd25e3488src">10</a> the same feats being assigned to several, and the
attributes of all claimed for almost any one. Here, then, were the
conditions provocative of doubt among the critical; and while it is
only in the later books of the Rig-Veda that such doubt finds priestly
expression, it must be inferred that it was current in some degree
among laymen before the hymn-makers avowed that they shared it. The God
Soma, the personification of wine, identified with the Moon-God
Chandra,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3500src" href="#xd25e3500" name=
"xd25e3500src">11</a> &ldquo;hurls the irreligious into the
abyss.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3506src" href="#xd25e3506"
name="xd25e3506src">12</a> This may mean that his cult, like that of
his congener Dionysos in Greece, was at first forcibly resisted, and
forcibly triumphed. At an earlier period doubt is directed against the
most popular God, Indra, perhaps on behalf of a rival cult.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3512src" href="#xd25e3512" name=
"xd25e3512src">13</a> Later it seems to take the shape of a
half-skeptical, half-mystical questioning as to which, if any, God is
real.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">From the Catholic standpoint, Dr. E. L. Fischer has
argued that &ldquo;Varuna is in the ontological, physical, and ethical
relation the highest, indeed the unique, God of ancient India&rdquo;;
and that the Nature-Gods of the Veda can belong only to a later period
in the religious consciousness (<i lang="de">Heidenthum und
Offenbarung</i>, 1878, pp. 36&ndash;37). Such a development, had it
really occurred, might be said to represent a movement of primitive
freethought from an unsatisfying monotheism to a polytheism that seemed
better to explain natural facts. A more plausible view of the process,
however, is that of von Bradke, to the effect that &ldquo;the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>old Indo-Germanic polytheism, with its pronounced
monarchic apex, which &hellip; constituted the religion of the
pre-Vedic [Aryan] Hindus, lost its monarchic apex shortly before and
during the Rig-Veda period, and set up for itself the so-called
Henotheism [worship of deities severally as if each were the only one],
which thus represented in India a time of religious decline; a decline
that, at the end of the period to which the Rig-Veda hymns belong, led
to an almost complete dissolution of the old beliefs. The earlier
collection of the hymns must have promoted the decline; and the final
redaction must have completed it. The collected hymns show only too
plainly how the very deity before whom in one song all the remaining
Gods bow themselves, in the next sinks almost in the dust before
another. Then there sounds from the Rig-Veda (x, 121) the wistful
question: Who is the God whom we should worship?&rdquo; (<i lang=
"de">Dy&acirc;us Asura, Ahuramazda, und die Asuras</i>, Halle, 1885, p.
115; cp. note, <i>supra</i>, p. 30). On this view the growth of
monotheism went on alongside of a growth of critical unbelief, but,
instead of expressing that, provoked it by way of reaction. Dr. Muir
more specifically argues (<i>Sanskrit Texts</i>, v, 116) that in the
Vedic hymns Varuna is a God in a state of decadence; and, despite the
dissent of M. Barth (<i>Religions of India</i>, p. 18), this seems
true. But the recession of Varuna is only in the normal way of the
eclipse of the old Supreme God by a nearer deity, and does not suffice
to prove a growth of agnosticism. M. Fontane (<i lang="fr">Inde
V&eacute;dique</i>, 1881, p. 305) asserts on other grounds a popular
movement of negation in the Vedic period, but offers rather slender
evidence. There is better ground for his account of the system as one
in which different cults had the upper hand at different times, the
devotees of Indra rejecting Agni, and so on (pp. 310&ndash;11).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To meet such a doubt, a pantheistic view of things would naturally
arise, and in the Vedas it often emerges.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3545src" href="#xd25e3545" name="xd25e3545src">14</a> Thus
&ldquo;Agni is all the Gods&rdquo;; and &ldquo;the Gods are only a
single being under different names.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3579src" href="#xd25e3579" name="xd25e3579src">15</a> For ancient
as for more civilized peoples such a doctrine had the attraction of
nominally reconciling the popular cult with the skepticism it had
aroused. Rising thus as freethought, the pantheistic doctrine in itself
ultimately became in India a dogmatic system, the monopoly of a
priestly caste, whose training <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51"
href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>in mystical dialectic made them
able to repel or baffle amateur criticism. Such fortifying of a
sophisticated creed by institutions&mdash;of which the Brahmanic caste
system is perhaps the strongest type&mdash;is one of the main
conditions of relative permanence for any set of opinions; yet even
within the Brahmanic system, by reason, presumably, of the principle
that the higher truth was for the adept and need not interfere with the
popular cult, there were again successive critical revisions of the
pantheistic idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Prof. Garbe (<i>Philosophy of Anc. India</i>, sect. on
<i>Hindu Monism</i>) argues that all monistic, and indeed all
progressive, thinking in ancient India arose not among the Brahmans,
who were conscienceless oppressors, but among the warrior caste; citing
stories in the Upanishads in which Brahmans are represented as
receiving such ideas from warriors. The thesis is much weakened by the
Professor&rsquo;s acceptance of Krishna as primarily a historic
character, of the warrior class. But there is ground for his general
thesis, which recognizes (p. 78) that the Brahmans at length
assimilated the higher thought of laymen. Max M&uuml;ller puts it that
&ldquo;No nation was ever so completely priestridden as the Hindus were
under the sway of the Brahmanic law. Yet, on the other side, the same
people were allowed to indulge in the most unrestrained freedom of
thought, and in the schools of their philosophy the very names of their
Gods were never mentioned. Their existence was neither denied nor
asserted&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; (<i>Selected Essays</i>, 1881, ii,
244). &ldquo;Sankhya philosophy&rdquo; [on which Buddhism is supposed
to be based], &ldquo;in its original form, claims the name of
<i>an-&icirc;svara</i>, &lsquo;lordless&rsquo; or
&lsquo;atheistic,&rsquo; as its distinctive title&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i>
p. 283).</p>
<p>Of the nature of a freethinking departure, among the early
Brahmanists as in other societies, was the substitution of non-human
for human sacrifices&mdash;a development of peaceful life-conditions
which, though not primitive, must have ante-dated Buddhism. See Tiele,
<i>Outlines</i>, pp. 126&ndash;27 and refs.; Barth, <i>Religions of
India</i>, pp. 57&ndash;59; and M&uuml;ller, <i>Physical Religion</i>,
p. 101. Prof. Robertson Smith (<i>Religion of the Semites</i>, p. 346)
appears to hold that animal sacrifice was never a substitute for human;
but his ingenious argument, on analysis, is found to prove only that in
certain cases the idea of such a substitution having taken place may
have been unhistorical. If it be granted that human sacrifices ever
occurred&mdash;and all the evidence goes to show that they were once
universal&mdash;substitution would be an obvious way of abolishing
them. Historical analogy is in favour of the view that the change was
forced on the priesthood from the outside, and only after a time
accepted by the Brahmans. Thus we find the Kh&acirc;rv&acirc;kas, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>school of freethinkers, rising in the Alexandrian
period, making it part of their business to denounce the Brahmanic
doctrine and practice of sacrifice, and to argue against all blood
sacrifices; but they had no practical success (Tiele, p. 126) until
Buddhism triumphed (Mitchell, <i>Hinduism</i>, 1885, p. 106; Rhys
Davids, tr. of <i>Dialogues of the Buddha</i>, 1899, p. 165).</p>

figured as the totality of matter,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3637src"

a desire or hope of reward; to deny, if not the existence, at least the

<p>And the critical development does not end there. &ldquo;In the old
Upanishads, in which the hymns and sacrifices of the Veda are looked
upon as useless, and as superseded by the higher knowledge taught by
the forest-sages, they are not yet attacked as mere impositions. That
opposition, however, sets in very decidedly in the Sutra period. In the

&ldquo;The Veda is tainted by the three faults of untruth,
self-contradiction, and tautology&#8202;&hellip;. The impostors who
call themselves Vedic pandits are mutually destructive&#8202;&hellip;.
The three authors of the Vedas were buffoons, knaves, and demons: All
the well-known formulas of the pandits, and all the horrid rites for
the queen commanded in the Asvamedha&mdash;these were invented by
buffoons, and so all the various kinds of presents to the priests;
while the eating of flesh was similarly commanded by night-prowling
demons.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3744src" href="#xd25e3744"

<p>To what extent such aggressive rationalism ever spread it is now
quite impossible to ascertain. It seems probable that the word
Lok&acirc;yata, defined by Sanskrit scholars as signifying
&ldquo;directed to the world of sense,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

learning.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3757src" href="#xd25e3757" name=

extensive, it came to be regarded as disposing men to unbelief, though

the eighth century of our era, it is found applied as a term of abuse,
in the sense of &ldquo;infidel,&rdquo; by Kum&acirc;rila in controversy

rational thought which can no more have taken place in ancient India

<p class="first">The phenomenon of the schism represented by the two
divisions of the Yazur Veda, the &ldquo;White&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Black,&rdquo; is plausibly accounted for as the outcome of the
tendencies of a new and an old school, who selected from their
Brahmanas, or treatises of ritual and theology, the portions which
respectively suited them. The implied critical movement would tend to
affect official thought in general. This schism is held by Weber to
have arisen only in the period of ferment set up by Buddhism; but other
disputes seem to have taken place in abundance in the Brahmanical
schools before that time. (Cp. Tiele, <i>Outlines</i>, p. 123; Weber,
<i>Hist. Ind. Lit.</i>, pp. 10, 27, 232; Max M&uuml;ller, <i>Anthropol.
Relig.</i>, 1892, pp. 36&ndash;37; and Rhys Davids, <i>Buddhism</i>, p.
34.) Again, the ascetic and penance-bearing hermits, who were
encouraged by the veneration paid them to exalt themselves above all
save the highest Gods, would by their utterances of necessity affect
the course of doctrine. Compare the same tendency as seen in Buddhism
and Jainism (Tiele, pp. 135, 140).</p>

<p>But in the later form of the Ved&acirc;nta, &ldquo;the end of the
Veda,&rdquo; a monistic and pantheistic teaching holds its ground in
our own day, after all the ups and downs of Brahmanism, alongside of
the aboriginal cults which Brahmanism adopted in its battle with
Buddhism; alongside, too, of the worship of the Veda itself as an
eternal and miraculous document. &ldquo;The leading tenets [of the
Ved&acirc;nta] are known to some extent in every
village.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3834src" href="#xd25e3834"
name="xd25e3834src">42</a> Yet the Ved&acirc;ntists, again, treat the
Upanishads in turn as a miraculous and inspired system,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3840src" href="#xd25e3840" name=
"xd25e3840src">43</a> and repeat in their case the process of the
Vedas: so sure is the law of fixation in religious thought, while the
habit of worship subsists.</p>
<p>The highest activity of rationalistic speculation within the
Brahmanic fold is seen to have followed intelligibly on the most
powerful reaction against the Brahmans&rsquo; authority. This took
place when their sphere had been extended from the region of the
Punjaub, of which alone the Rig-Veda shows knowledge, to the great
kingdoms of Southern India, pointed to in the Sutras,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e3851src" href="#xd25e3851" name="xd25e3851src">44</a> or short
digests of ritual and law designed for general official use. In the new
environment &ldquo;there was a well-marked lay-feeling, a widespread
antagonism to the priests, a real sense of humour, a strong fund of
common sense. Above all there was the most complete and unquestioned
freedom of thought and expression in religious matters that the world
had yet witnessed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3857src" href=
"#xd25e3857" name="xd25e3857src">45</a></p>
<p>The most popular basis for rejection of a given system&mdash;belief
in another&mdash;made ultimately possible there the rise of a
practically atheistic system capable, wherever embraced, of annulling
the burdensome and exclusive system of the Brahmans, which had been
obtruded in its worst form,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3871src" href=
"#xd25e3871" name="xd25e3871src">46</a> though not dominantly, in the
new environment. Buddhism, though it cannot have arisen on one
man&rsquo;s initiative in the manner claimed in the legends, even as
stripped of their supernaturalist element,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3883src" href="#xd25e3883" name="xd25e3883src">47</a> was in its
origin essentially a movement of freethought, such as could have arisen
only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>in the atmosphere of a much mixed society<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e3897src" href="#xd25e3897" name=
"xd25e3897src">48</a> where the extreme Brahmanical claims were on
various grounds discredited, perhaps even within their own
newly-adjusted body. It was stigmatized as &ldquo;the science of
reason,&rdquo; a term equivalent to &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; in the
Christian sphere;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3903src" href="#xd25e3903"
name="xd25e3903src">49</a> and its definite rejection of the Vedas made
it anti-sacerdotal even while it retained the modes of speech of
polytheism. The tradition which makes the Buddha<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e3907src" href="#xd25e3907" name="xd25e3907src">50</a> a prince
suggests an upper-class origin for the reaction; and there are traces
of a chronic resistance to the Brahmans&rsquo; rule among their
fellow-Aryans before the Buddhist period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The royal families, the warriors, who, it may
be supposed, strenuously supported the priesthood so long as it was a
question of robbing the people of their rights, now that this was
effected turned against their former allies, and sought to throw off
the yoke that was likewise laid upon them. These efforts were, however,
unavailing: the colossus was too firmly established. Obscure legends
and isolated allusions are the only records left to us in the later
writings of the sacrilegious hands which ventured to attack the sacred
and divinely consecrated majesty of the Brahmans; and these are careful
to note at the same time the terrible punishments which befel those
impious offenders&rdquo; (Weber, <i>Hist. Ind. Lit.</i>, p. 19).</p>

<p>The circumstances, however, that the Buddhist writings were from the

conception of Karma, the transition of the soul, or rather of the
personality, through many stages up to that in which, by
self-discipline, it attains the impersonal peace of Nirvana; and of
this conception there is no trace in the Vedas,<a class="noteref" id=

became a leading tenet of Brahmanism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">To the dissolvent influence of Greek culture may
possibly be due some part of the success of Buddhism before our era,
and even later. Hindu astronomy in the Vedic period was but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>slightly developed (Weber, <i>Hist. Ind. Lit.</i>,
pp. 246, 249, 250); and &ldquo;it was Greek influence that first
infused a real life into Indian astronomy&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i> p. 251;
cp. Letronne, <i lang="fr">M&eacute;langes
d&rsquo;&Eacute;rudition</i>, 1860 (?), p. 40; Narrien, <i>Histor. Acc.
of Orig. and Prog. of Astron.</i>, p. 33, and Lib. Use. Kn. <i>Hist. of
Astron.</i>, c. ii). This implies other interactions. It is presumably
to Greek stimulus that we must trace the knowledge by Aryabhata
(Colebrooke&rsquo;s <i>Essays</i>, ed. 1873, ii, 404; cp. Weber, p.
257) of the doctrine of the earth&rsquo;s diurnal revolution on its
axis; and the fact that in India as in the Mediterranean world the
truth was later lost from men&rsquo;s hands may be taken as one of the
proofs that the two civilizations alike retrograded owing to evil
political conditions. In the progressive period (from about 320
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> onwards for perhaps some centuries) Greek
ideas might well help to discredit traditionalism; and their acceptance
at royal courts would be favourable to toleration of the new teaching.
At the same time, Buddhism must have been favoured by the native mental
climate in which it arose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main differentiation of Buddhism from Brahmanism, again, is its
ethical spirit, which sets aside formalism and seeks salvation in an
inward reverie and discipline; and this element in turn can hardly be
conceived as arising save in an old society, far removed from the
warlike stage represented by the Vedas. Whatever may have been its
early association with Brahmanism<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3982src"
href="#xd25e3982" name="xd25e3982src">56</a> then, it must be regarded
as essentially a reaction against Brahmanical doctrine and ideals; a
circumstance which would account for its early acceptance in the
Punjaub, where Brahmanism had never attained absolute power and was
jealously resisted by the free population.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4004src" href="#xd25e4004" name="xd25e4004src">57</a> And the
fact that Jainism, so closely akin to Buddhism, has its sacred books in
a dialect belonging to the region in which Buddhism arose, further
supports the view that the reaction grew out of the thought of a type
of society differing widely from that in which Brahmanism arose.
Jainism, like Buddhism, is substantially atheistic,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e4010src" href="#xd25e4010" name="xd25e4010src">58</a> and like
it has an ancient monkish organization to which women were early
admitted. The original crypto-atheism or agnosticism of the Buddhist
movement thus appears as a product of a relatively high, because
complex, moral and intellectual evolution. It certainly never impugned
the belief in the Gods; on the contrary, the Buddha is often
represented as speaking of their existence,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4018src" href="#xd25e4018" name="xd25e4018src">59</a> and at
times as approving of their customary worship;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4024src" href="#xd25e4024" name="xd25e4024src">60</a> but he is
never <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>said to counsel his own order to pray to them; he
makes light of sacrifice; and above all he is made quite negative as to
a future life, preaching the doctrine of Karma in a sense which
excludes individual immortality.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4033src"
href="#xd25e4033" name="xd25e4033src">61</a> &ldquo;It cannot be denied
that if we call the old Gods of the Veda&mdash;Indra and Agni and
Yama&mdash;Gods, Buddha was an atheist. He does not believe in the
divinity of these deities. What is noteworthy is that he does not by
any means deny their bare existence&#8202;&hellip;. The founder of
Buddhism treats the old Gods as superhuman beings.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4045src" href="#xd25e4045" name=
"xd25e4045src">62</a> Thus it is permissible to say both that Buddhism
recognizes Gods and that it is practically atheistic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The fact cannot be disputed away that the
religion of Buddha was from the beginning purely atheistic. The idea of
the Godhead &hellip; was for a time at least expelled from the
sanctuary of the human mind,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4054src" href=
"#xd25e4054" name="xd25e4054src">63</a> and the highest morality that
was ever taught before the rise of Christianity was taught by men with
whom the Gods had become mere phantoms, without any altars, not even an
altar to the unknown God&rdquo; (Max M&uuml;ller, <i>Introd. to the
Science of Religion</i>, ed. 1882, p. 81. Cp. the same author&rsquo;s
<i>Selected Essays</i>, 1881, ii, 300.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;He [Buddha] ignores God in so complete a way that he does not
even seek to deny him; he does not suppress him, but he does not speak
of him either to explain the origin and anterior existence of man or to
explain the present life, or to conjecture his future life and
definitive deliverance. The Buddha knows God in no fashion
whatever&rdquo; (Barth&eacute;lemy Saint-Hilaire, <i lang="fr">Le
Bouddha et sa Religion</i>, 1866, p. v).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buddhism and Christianity are indeed the two opposite poles
with regard to the most essential points of religion: Buddhism ignoring
all feeling of dependence on a higher power, and therefore denying the
very existence of a supreme deity&rdquo; (M&uuml;ller, <i>Introd. to
Sc. of Rel.</i>, p. 171).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lastly, the Buddha declared that he had arrived at [his]
conclusions, not by study of the Vedas, nor from the teachings of
others, but by the light of reason and intuition alone&rdquo; (Rhys
Davids, <i>Buddhism</i>, p. 48). &ldquo;The most ancient Buddhism
despises dreams and visions&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i>, p. 177).
&ldquo;Agnostic atheism &hellip; is the characteristic of his
[Buddha&rsquo;s] system of philosophy&rdquo; (<i>Id.</i>, p. 207).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belief in a Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of the
Universe, is unquestionably a modern graft upon the unqualified atheism
of S&aacute;kya Muni: it is still of very limited recognition. In none
of the standard authorities &hellip; is there the slightest
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>allusion to such a First Cause, the existence of
which is incompatible with the fundamental Buddhist dogma of the
eternity of all existence&rdquo; (H. H. Wilson, <i>Buddha and
Buddhism</i>, in <i>Essays and Lectures</i>, ed. by Dr. R. Rost, 1862,
ii, 361. Cp. p. 363).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the gradual colouring of Buddhism with popular
mythology, the reversion (if, indeed, this were not early) to adoration
and worship of the Buddha himself, and the final collapse of the system
in India before the pressure of Brahmanized Hinduism, all prove the
potency of the sociological conditions of success and failure for
creeds and criticisms. Buddhism took the monastic form for its
institutions, thus incurring ultimate petrifaction alike morally and
intellectually; and in any case the normal Indian social conditions of
abundant population, cheap food, and general ignorance involved an
overwhelming vitality for the popular cults. These the orthodox
Brahmans naturally took under their protection as a means of
maintaining their hold over the multitude;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4098src" href="#xd25e4098" name="xd25e4098src">64</a> and though
their own highest philosophy has been poetically grafted on that basis,
as in the epic of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata and in the Bhagavat
Gita,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4112src" href="#xd25e4112" name=
"xd25e4112src">65</a> the ordinary worship of the deities of these
poems is perforce utterly unphilosophical, varying between a primitive
sensualism and an emotionalism closely akin to that of popular forms of
Christianity. Buddhism itself, where it still prevails, exhibits
similar tendencies.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4118src" href=
"#xd25e4118" name="xd25e4118src">66</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is disputed whether the Brahman influence drove
Buddhism out of India by physical force, or whether the latter decayed
because of maladaptation to its environment. Its vogue for some seven
hundred years, from about 300 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> to about 400
<span class="sc">A.C.</span>, seems to have been largely due to its
protection and final acceptance as a State religion by the dynasty of
Chandragupta (the Sandracottos of the Greek historians), whose grandson
Asoka showed it special favour. His rock-inscribed edicts (for which
see Max M&uuml;ller, <i>Introd. to Science of Rel.</i>, pp. 5&ndash;6,
23; <i>Anthrop. Relig.</i>, pp. 40&ndash;43; Rhys Davids,
<i>Buddhism</i>, pp. 220&ndash;28; Wheeler&rsquo;s <i>Hist. of
India</i>, vol. iii, app. 1; Asiatic Society&rsquo;s <i>Journals</i>,
vols. viii and xii; <i>Indian Antiquary</i>, 1877, vol. vi) show a
general concern for natural ethics, and especially for tolerance; but
his mention of &ldquo;The Terrors of the Future&rdquo; among the
religious works he specially honours shows (if genuine) that normal
superstition, if ever widely repudiated (which is doubtful), had
interpenetrated the system. The king, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>too, called himself
&ldquo;the delight of the Gods,&rdquo; as did his contemporary the
Buddhist king of Ceylon (Davids, <i>Buddhism</i>, p. 84). Under Asoka,
however, Buddhism was powerful enough to react somewhat on the West,
then in contact with India as a result of the Alexandrian conquest (cp.
Mahaffy, <i>Greek World under Roman Sway</i>, ch. ii; Weber&rsquo;s
lecture on Ancient India, Eng. tr., pp. 25&ndash;26; <i lang=
"de">Indische Skizzen</i>, p. 28 [cited in the present writer&rsquo;s
<i>Christianity and Mythology</i>, p. 165]; and Weber&rsquo;s <i>Hist
of Ind. Lit.</i>, p. 255 and p. 309, <i>note</i>); and the fact that
after his time it entered on a long conflict with Brahmanism proves
that it remained practically dangerous to that system. In the fifth and
sixth centuries of our era Buddhism in India &ldquo;rapidly
declined&rdquo;&mdash;a circumstance hardly intelligible save as a
result of violence. Tiele, after expressly asserting the &ldquo;rapid
decline&rdquo; (<i>Outlines</i>, p. 139), in the next breath asserts
that there are no satisfactory proofs of such violence, and that,
&ldquo;on the contrary, Buddhism appears to have pined away
<i>slowly</i>&rdquo; (p. 140: contrast his <i>Egypt. Rel.</i>, p. xxi).
Rhys Davids, in his <i>Buddhism</i>, p. 246 (so also Max M&uuml;ller,
<i>Anthrop. Rel.</i>, p. 43), argues for a process of violent
extinction; but in his later work, <i>Buddhist India</i>, he retracts
this view and decides for a gradual decline in the face of a Brahmanic
revival. The evidences for violence and persecution are, however,
pretty strong. (See H. H. Wilson, <i>Essays</i>, as cited, ii,
365&ndash;67.) Internal decay certainly appears to have occurred.
Already in Gautama&rsquo;s own life, according to the legends, there
were doctrinal disputes within his party (M&uuml;ller, <i>Anthrop.
Rel.</i>, p. 38); and soon heresies and censures abounded (<i>Introd.
to Sc. of Rel.</i>, p. 23), till schisms arose and no fewer
<span class="corr" id="xd25e4204" title="Source: then">than</span>
eighteen sects took shape (Davids, <i>Buddhism</i>, pp.
213&ndash;18).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus early in our inquiry we may gather, from a fairly complete
historical case, the primary laws of causation as regards alike the
progress and the decadence of movements of rationalistic thought. The
fundamental economic dilemma, seen already in the life of the savage,
presses at all stages of civilization. The credent multitude, save in
the very lowest stages of savage destitution, always feeds and houses
those who furnish it with its appropriate mental food; and so long as
there remains the individual struggle for existence, there will always
be teachers ready. If the higher minds in any priesthood, awaking to
the character of their traditional teaching, withdraw from it, lower
minds, howbeit &ldquo;sincere,&rdquo; will always take their place. The
innovating teacher, in turn, is only at the beginning of his troubles
when he contrives, on whatever bases, to set up a new organized
movement. The very process of organization, on the one hand, sets up
the call for special economic sustenance&mdash;a constant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>motive
to compromise with popular ignorance&mdash;and, on the other hand,
tends to establish merely a new traditionalism, devoid of the critical
impulse in which it arose.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4215src" href=
"#xd25e4215" name="xd25e4215src">67</a> And without organization the
innovating thought cannot communicate itself, cannot hold its own
against the huge social pressures of tradition.</p>
<p>In ancient society, in short, there could be no continuous progress
in freethinking: at best, there could but be periods or lines of
relative progress, the result of special conjunctures of social and
political circumstance. So much will appear, further, from the varying
instances of still more ancient civilizations, the evolution of which
may be the better understood from our survey of that of India.</p>

<p class="first">The nature of the remains we possess of the ancient
Babylonian and Assyrian religions is not such as to yield a direct
record of their development; but they suffice to show that there, as
elsewhere, a measure of rationalistic evolution occurred. Were there no
other ground for the inference, it might not unreasonably be drawn from
the post-exilic monotheism of the Hebrews, who, drawing so much of
their cosmology and temple ritual from Babylon, may be presumed to have
been influenced by the higher Semitic civilizations in other ways
also.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4230src" href="#xd25e4230" name=
"xd25e4230src">68</a> But there is concrete evidence. What appears to
have happened in Babylonia and Assyria, whose religious systems were
grafted on that of the more ancient Sumer-Akkadian civilization, is a
gradual subordination of the numerous local Gods (at least in the
thought of the more philosophic, including some of the priests) to the
conception of one all-pervading power. This process would be assisted
by that of imperialism; and in the recently-recovered code of Hammurabi
we actually find references to <i>Ilu</i> &ldquo;God&rdquo; (as in the
European legal phrase, &ldquo;the act of God&rdquo;) without any
further God-name.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4239src" href="#xd25e4239"
name="xd25e4239src">69</a> On the other hand, the unifying tendency
would be resisted by the strength of the traditions of the Babylonian
cities, all of which had ancient cults before the later empires were
built up.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4244src" href="#xd25e4244" name=
"xd25e4244src">70</a> Yet, again, peoples who failed in war would be in
some measure led to renounce their God as weak; while those who clung
to their faith <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>would be led, as in Jewry, to recast its ethic.
The result was a set of compromises in which the provincial and foreign
deities were either treated genealogically or grouped in family or
other relations with the chief God or Gods of the time being.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4259src" href="#xd25e4259" name=
"xd25e4259src">71</a> Certain cults, again, were either kept always at
a higher ethical level than the popular one, or were treated by the
more refined and more critical worshippers in an elevated
spirit;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4265src" href="#xd25e4265" name=
"xd25e4265src">72</a> and this tendency seems to have led to
conceptions of purified deities who underlay or transcended the popular
types, the names of the latter being held to point to one who was
misconceived under their grosser aspects.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4271src" href="#xd25e4271" name="xd25e4271src">73</a>
Astronomical knowledge, again, gave rise to cosmological theories which
pointed to a ruling and creating God,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4283src" href="#xd25e4283" name="xd25e4283src">74</a> who as such
would have a specially ethical character. In some such way was reached
a conception of a Creator-God as the unity represented by the fifty
names of the Great Gods, who lost their personality when their names
were liturgically given to him<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4295src"

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It might be taken for granted, further, that disbelief
would be set up by such a primitive fraud as the alleged pretence of
the priests of Bel Merodach that the God cohabited nightly with the
concubine set apart for him (Herodotos, i, 181&ndash;82), as was
similarly pretended by the priests of Amun at Thebes. Herodotos could
not believe the story, which, indeed, is probably a late Greek fable;
but there must have been some skeptics within the sphere of the Semitic
cult of sacred prostitution.</p>
<p>As regards freethinking in general, much would depend on the
development of the Chald&aelig;an astronomy. That science, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>growing
out of primitive astrology (cp. Whewell, <i>Hist. of the Induct.
Sciences</i>, 3rd ed. i, 108), would tend to discredit, among its
experts, much of the prevailing religious thought; and they seem to
have carried it so far as to frame a scientific theory of comets
(Seneca, citing Apollonius Myndius, <i lang="la">Quaest. Nat.</i>, vii,
3; cp. Lib. Use. Kn. <i>Hist. of Astron.</i>, c. 3; E. Meyer, <i lang=
"de">Gesch. des Alterthums</i>, i, 186; and Weber, <i>Ind. Lit.</i>, p.
248). Such knowledge would greatly favour skepticism, as well as
monotheism and pantheism. It was sought to be astrologically applied;
but, as the horoscopes varied, this was again a source of unbelief
(Meyer, p. 179). Medicine, again, made little progress (Herod., i,
197).</p>
<p>It can hardly be doubted, finally, that in Babylonia and Assyria
there were idealists who, like the Hebrew prophets, repudiated alike
image-worship and the religion of sacrifices. The latter repudiation
occurs frequently in later Greece and Rome. There, as in Jerusalem, it
could make itself heard in virtue of the restrictedness of the power of
the priests, who in imperial Babylonia and Assyria, on the other hand,
might be trusted to suppress or override any such propaganda, as we
have seen was done in Brahmanical India.</p>
<p>Concerning image-worship, apart from the proved fact of pantheistic
doctrine, and the parallels in Egypt and India, it is to be noted that
Isaiah actually puts in the mouth of the Assyrian king a tirade against
the &ldquo;kingdoms of the idols&rdquo; or &ldquo;false gods,&rdquo;
including in these Jerusalem and Samaria (<a class="biblink xd25e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2010:10-11&amp;version=NRSV">Isa.
x, 10, 11</a>). The passage is dramatic, but it points to the
possibility that in Assyria just as in Israel a disbelief in idols
could arise from reflection on the spectacle of their multitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chequered political history of Babylon and Assyria, however,
made impossible any long-continued development of critical and
philosophical thought. Their amalgamations of creeds and races had in a
measure favoured such development;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4368src"
href="#xd25e4368" name="xd25e4368src">81</a> and it was probably the
setting up of a single rule over large populations formerly at chronic
war that reduced to a minimum, if it did not wholly abolish, human
sacrifice in the later pre-Persian empires;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4371src" href="#xd25e4371" name="xd25e4371src">82</a> but the
inevitably subject state of the mass of the people, and the chronic
military upset of the government, were conditions fatally favourable to
ordinary superstition. The new universalist conceptions, instead of
dissolving the special cults in pantheism, led only to a fresh
competition of cults on cosmopolitan lines, all making the same
pretensions, and stressing their most artificial peculiarities as
all-important. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>Thus, when old tribal or local religions went
proselytizing in the enlarged imperial field, they made their most
worthless stipulations&mdash;as Jewish circumcision and abstinence from
pork, and the self-mutilation of the followers of
Cybel&ecirc;&mdash;the very grounds of salvation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4379src" href="#xd25e4379" name="xd25e4379src">83</a> Culture
remained wholly in the hands of the priestly and official
class,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4382src" href="#xd25e4382" name=
"xd25e4382src">84</a> who, like the priesthoods of Egypt, were held to
conservatism by their vast wealth.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4389src"
href="#xd25e4389" name="xd25e4389src">85</a> Accordingly we find the
early religion of sorcery maintaining itself in the literature of the
advanced empires.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4395src" href="#xd25e4395"
name="xd25e4395src">86</a> The attitude of the Semitic priests and
scribes towards the old Akkadic as a sacred language was in itself,
like the use of sacred books in general, long a check upon new
thought;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4398src" href="#xd25e4398" name=
"xd25e4398src">87</a> and though the Assyrian life seems to have set
this check aside, by reason of the lack of a culture class in Assyria,
the later Babylonian kingdom which rose on the fall of Assyria was too
short-lived to profit much by the gain, being in turn overthrown in the
second generation by Cyrus. It is significant that the conqueror was
welcomed by the Babylonian priests as against their last king, the
inquiring and innovating Nabonidos<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4401src"
href="#xd25e4401" name="xd25e4401src">88</a> (Nabu-nahid), who had
aimed at a monarchic polytheism or quasi-monotheism. He is described as
having turned away from Mardouk (Merodach), the great Babylonian God,
who accordingly accepted Cyrus in his stead. It is thus clear that
Cyrus, who restored the old state of things, was no strict monotheist
of the later Persian type, but a schemer who relied everywhere on
popular religious interests, and conciliated the polytheists and
henotheists of Babylon as he did the Yahweh-worshipping Jews.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4407src" href="#xd25e4407" name=
"xd25e4407src">89</a> The Persian quasi-monotheism and anti-idolatry,
however, already existed, and it is conceivable that they may have been
intensified among the more cultured through the peculiar juxtaposition
of cults set up by the Persian conquest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Mr. Sayce&rsquo;s dictum (Hib. Lect., p. 314), that
the later ethical element in the Akkado-Babylonian system is
&ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; due to Semitic race elements, is seen to be
fallacious in the light of his own subsequent admission (p. 353) as to
the lateness of the development among the Semites. The difference
between early Akkadian and later Babylonian was simply one of
culture-stage. See Mr. Sayce&rsquo;s own remarks on p. 300; and compare
E. Meyer (<i lang="de">Gesch. des Alt.</i>, i, 178, 182, 183), who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>entirely rejects the claim made for Semitic
ethics. See, again, Tiele, <i>Outlines</i>, p. 78, and Mr.
Sayce&rsquo;s own account (<i>Anc. Em. of the East</i>, p. 202) of the
<i>Ph&oelig;nician</i> religion as &ldquo;impure and cruel.&rdquo;
Other writers take the line of arguing that the Ph&oelig;nicians were
&ldquo;not Semites,&rdquo; and that they differed in all things from
the true Semites (cp. Dr. Marcus Dods, <i>Israel&rsquo;s Iron Age</i>,
1874, p. 10, and Farrar, as there cited). The explanation of such
arbitrary judgments seems to be that the Semites are assumed to have
had a primordial religious gift as compared with
&ldquo;Turanians,&rdquo; and that the Hebrews in turn are assumed to
have been so gifted above other Semites. We shall best guard against
&agrave; priori injustice to the Semites themselves, in the
conjunctures in which they really advanced civilization, by entirely
discarding the unscientific method of explaining the history of races
in terms of hereditary character (see below, &sect; 6, <i>end</i>).</p>

<p class="first">The Mazdean system, or worship of Ahura Mazda
(Ormazd), of which we find in Herodotos positive historical record as
an anti-idolatrous and nominally monotheistic creed<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e4442src" href="#xd25e4442" name="xd25e4442src">90</a> in the
fifth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, is the first to which these
aspects can be ascribed with certainty. As the Jews are found
represented in the Book of Jeremiah<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4448src"
href="#xd25e4448" name="xd25e4448src">91</a> (assumed to have been
written in the sixth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>) worshipping
numerous Gods with images: and as polytheistic and idolatrous practices
are still described in the Book of Ezekiel<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4459src" href="#xd25e4459" name="xd25e4459src">92</a> (assumed to
have been written during or after the Babylonian Captivity), it is
inadmissible to accept the unauthenticated writings of ostensibly
earlier prophets as proving even a propaganda of monotheism on their
part, the so-called Mosaic law being known to be in large part of late
invention and of Babylonian derivation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4463src" href="#xd25e4463" name="xd25e4463src">93</a> In any
case, the mass of the people were clearly image-worshippers. The
Persians, on the other hand, can be taken with certainty to have had in
the sixth century an imageless worship (though images existed for other
purposes), with a supreme God set above all others. The Magian or
Mazdean creed, as we have seen, was not very devoutly held by Cyrus;
but Dareios a generation later is found holding it with zeal; and it
cannot have grown in a generation to the form it then bore. It must
therefore be regarded as a development of the religion of some section
of the &ldquo;Iranian&rdquo; race, <span class="corr" id="xd25e4466"
title="Source: centring">centering</span> as it does round some deities
common to the Vedic Aryans.</p>
<p>The Mazdean system, as we first trace it in history, was the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>religion of the Medes, a people joined with the
Persians proper under Cyrus; and the Magi or priests were one of the
seven tribes of the Medes,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4473src" href=
"#xd25e4473" name="xd25e4473src">94</a> as the Levites were one of the
tribes of Israel. It may then be conjectured that the Magi were the
priests of a people who previously conquered or were conquered by the
Medes, who had then adopted their religion, as did the Persians after
their conquest by or union with the Medes. Cyrus, a semi-Persian, may
well have regarded the Medes with some racial distrust, and, while
using them as the national priests, would naturally not be devout in
his adherence at a time when the two peoples were still mutually
jealous. When, later, after the assassination of his son Smerdis
(Bardes or Bardija) by the elder son, King Cambyses, and the death of
the latter, the Median and Magian interest set up the &ldquo;false
Smerdis,&rdquo; Persian conspirators overthrew the pretender and
crowned the Persian Dareios Hystaspis, marking their sense of hostility
to the Median and Magian element by a general massacre of
Magi.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4476src" href="#xd25e4476" name=
"xd25e4476src">95</a> Those Magi who survived would naturally cultivate
the more their priestly influence, the political being thus for the
time destroyed; though they seem to have stirred up a Median
insurrection in the next century against Dareios II.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e4481src" href="#xd25e4481" name="xd25e4481src">96</a> However
that may be, Dareios I became a zealous devotee of their
creed,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4490src" href="#xd25e4490" name=
"xd25e4490src">97</a> doubtless finding that a useful means of
conciliating the Medes in general, who at the outset of his reign seem
to have given him much trouble.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4502src"

original home of the worship of Ahura-Mazda.<a class="noteref" id=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Such is the view of the case derivable from Herodotos,
who remains the main authority; but recent critics have raised some
difficulties. That the Magians were originally a non-Median tribe seems
clear; Dr. Tiele (<i>Outlines</i>, pp. 163, 165) even decides that they
were certainly non-Aryan. Compare Ed. Meyer (<i lang="de">Gesch. des
Alt.</i><span class="corr" id="xd25e4522" title=
"Not in source">,</span> i, 530, <i>note</i>, 531, &sect;&sect; 439,
440), who holds that the Mazdean system was in its nature not national
but abstract, and could therefore take in any race. Several modern
writers, however (Canon Rawlinson, ed. of Herodotos, i, 426&ndash;31;
<i>Five Great Monarchies</i>, 2nd ed. ii, 345&ndash;55, iii,
402&ndash;404; Lenormant, <i>Chaldean Magic</i>, Eng. tr. pp. 197,
218&ndash;39; Sayce, <i>Anc. Emp. of the East</i>, p. 248), represent
the Magians as not only anti-Aryan (= anti-Persian), but opposed to the
very worship of Ormazd, which is specially associated with their name.
It seems difficult to reconcile this view with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>facts;
at least it involves the assumption of two opposed sets of Magi. The
main basis for the theory seems to be the allusion in the Behistun
inscription of Dareios to some acts of temple-destruction by the
usurping Magian Gomates, brother and controller of the pretender
Smerdis. (See the inscription translated in <i>Records of the Past</i>,
i, 111&ndash;15.) This Meyer sets aside as an unsettled problem,
without inferring that the Magians were anti-Mazdean (cp. &sect; 449
and &sect; 511, <i>note</i>). As to the massacre, however, Meyer
decides (i, 613) that Herodotos blundered, magnifying the killing of
&ldquo;the Magus&rdquo; into a slaughter of &ldquo;the Magi.&rdquo; But
this is one of the few points at which Herodotos is corroborated by
Ktesias (cp. Grote, iii, 440, <i>note</i>). A clue to a solution may
perhaps be found in the facts that, while the priestly system remained
opposed to all image-worship, Dareios made emblematic images of the
Supreme God (Meyer, i, 213, 617) and of Mithra; and that Artaxerxes
Mnemon later put an image of Mithra in the royal temple of Susa,
besides erecting many images to Anaitis. (Rawlinson, <i>Five Great
Monarchies</i>, iii, 320&ndash;21, 360&ndash;61.) There may have been
opposing tendencies; the conquest of Babylon being likely to have
introduced new elements. The Persian art now arising shows the most
marked Assyrian influences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The religion thus imposed on the Persians seems to have been
imageless by reason of the simple defect of art among its
cultivators;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4555src" href="#xd25e4555"
name="xd25e4555src">101</a> and to have been monotheistic only in the
sense that its chief deity was supreme over all others, including even
the great Evil Power, Ahriman (Angra Mainyu). Its God-group included
Mithra, once the equal of Ahura-Mazda,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4558src" href="#xd25e4558" name="xd25e4558src">102</a> and later
more prominent than he;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4564src" href=
"#xd25e4564" name="xd25e4564src">103</a> as well as a Goddess, Anahita,
apparently of Akkadian origin. Before the period of Cyrus, the eastern
part of Persia seems to have been but little civilized;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e4570src" href="#xd25e4570" name=
"xd25e4570src">104</a> and it was probably there that its original lack
of images became an essential element in the doctrine of its priests.
As we find it in history, and still more in its sacred book, the
Zendavesta, which as we have it represents a late liturgical
compilation,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4573src" href="#xd25e4573"
name="xd25e4573src">105</a> Mazdeism is a priest-made religion rather
than the work of one Zarathustra or any one reformer; and its rejection
of images, however originated, is to be counted to the credit of its
priests, like the pantheism or nominal monotheism of the Mesopotamian,
Brahmanic, and Egyptian religions. The original popular faith had
clearly been a normal polytheism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4580src"
href="#xd25e4580" name="xd25e4580src">106</a> For the rest, the Mazdean
ethic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=

virtue it assigns to sacrifice;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4585src"
href="#xd25e4585" name="xd25e4585src">107</a> but otherwise compares
favourably with Brahmanism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As to this cult being priest-made, see Meyer, i, 523,
540, 541. Tiele (<i>Outlines</i>, pp. 167, 178) assumes a special
reformation such as is traditionally associated with Zarathustra,
holding that either a remarkable man or a sect must have established
the monotheistic idea. Meyer (i, 537) holds with M. Darmesteter that
Zarathustra is a purely mythical personage, made out of a Storm-God.
Dr. Menzies (<i>Hist. of Relig.</i> p. 384) holds strongly by his
historic actuality. The problem is analogous to those concerning Moses
and Buddha; but though the historic case of Mohammed bars a confident
decision in the negative, the balance of presumption is strongly
against the traditional view. See the author&rsquo;s <i>Pagan
Christs</i>, pp. 286&ndash;88.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no reason to believe, however, that among the Persian
peoples the higher view of things fared any better than
elsewhere.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4609src" href="#xd25e4609" name=
"xd25e4609src">108</a> The priesthood, however enlightened it may have
been in its inner culture, never slackened the practice of sacrifice
and ceremonial; and the worship of subordinate spirits and the
propitiation of demons figured as largely in their beliefs as in any
other. In time the cult of the Saviour-God Mithra came to the front
very much as did that of Jesus later; and in the one case as in the
other, despite ethical elements, superstition was furthered. When,
still later, the recognition of Ahriman was found to endanger the
monotheistic principle, an attempt seems to have been made under the
Sassanian dynasty, in our own era, to save it by positing a deity who
was father of both Ahura-Mazda and Angra-mainyu;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4612src" href="#xd25e4612" name="xd25e4612src">109</a> but this

and political obstacles determined the fate of Magian as of other
ancient rationalism.</p>

<p class="first">According to Rawlinson, Zoroastrianism under the
Parthian (Arsacide) empire was gradually converted into a complex
system of idolatry, involving a worship of ancestors and dead kings
(<i>Sixth Orient. Mon.</i> p. 399; <i>Seventh Mon.</i> pp. 8&ndash;9,

pronounces the Parthians zealous followers of Zoroastrianism, dutifully
obeying it in the treatment of their dead (<i lang="de">Geschichte

normal polytheism, the dualistic faith and the supremacy of Ormazd were

<p class="first">The relatively rich store of memorials left by the
Egyptian religions yields us hardly any more direct light on the growth
of religious rationalism than do those of Mesopotamia, though it
supplies much fuller proof that such a growth took place. All that is
clear is that the comparison and competition of henotheistic cults
there as elsewhere led to a measure of relative skepticism, which took
doctrinal shape in a loose monism or pantheism. The language is often
monotheistic, but never, in the early period, is polytheism excluded;
on the contrary, it is affirmed in the same breath.<a class="noteref"

alternate ascendancy of different dynasties, with different Gods,

"xd25e4725src" href="#xd25e4725" name="xd25e4725src">119</a> There had
occurred, in short, among the educated and priestly class a
considerable development, going on through many centuries, alike in
philosophical and in ethical thought; the ethics of the Egyptian
&ldquo;Book of the Dead&rdquo; being quite as altruistic as those of
any portion of the much later Christian Gospels.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4728src" href="#xd25e4728" name="xd25e4728src">120</a> Such a
development could arise only in long periods of peace and law-abiding
life; though it is found to be accelerated after the Persian conquest,
which would force upon the Egyptian priesthood new comparisons and
accommodations.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4737src" href="#xd25e4737"
name="xd25e4737src">121</a> And yet all this was done &ldquo;without
ever sacrificing the least particle of the beliefs of the
past.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4740src" href="#xd25e4740"
name="xd25e4740src">122</a> The popular polytheism, resting on absolute
ignorance, was indestructible; and the most philosophic priests seem
never to have dreamt of unsettling it, though, as we shall see, a
masterful king did.</p>
<p>An eminent Egyptologist has written that, &ldquo;whatever literary
treasures may be brought to light in the future as the result of
excavations in Egypt, it is most improbable that we shall ever receive
from that country any ancient Egyptian work which can properly be
classed among the literature of atheism or freethought; the Egyptian
might be more or less religious according to his nature and
temperament, but, <i>judging from the writings of his priests and
teachers which are now in our hands</i>, the man who was without
religion and God in some form or other was most rare, if not
unknown.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4751src" href="#xd25e4751"
name="xd25e4751src">123</a> It is not clear what significance the
writer attaches to this statement. Unquestionably the mass of the
Egyptians were always na&iuml;f believers in all that was given them as
religion; and among the common people even the minds which, as
elsewhere, varied from the norm of credulity would be too much cowed by
the universal parade of religion to impugn it; while their ignorance
and general crudity of life would preclude coherent critical thought on
the subject. But to conclude that among the priesthood and the upper
classes there was never any &ldquo;freethinking&rdquo; in the sense of
disbelief in the popular and official religion, even up to the point of
pantheism or atheism, is to ignore the general lesson of culture
history elsewhere. Necessarily there was no &ldquo;literature of
atheism or freethought.&rdquo; Such literature could have no public,
and, as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>menace to the wealth and status of the priesthood,
would have brought death on the writer. But in such a multitudinous
priesthood there must have been, at some stages, many who realized the
mummery of the routine religion, and some who transcended the
commonplaces of theistic thought. From the former, if not from the
latter, would come esoteric explanations for the benefit of the more
intelligent of the laity of the official class, who could read; and it
is idle to decide that deeper unbelief was privately
&ldquo;unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is contended, as against the notion of an esoteric and an
exoteric doctrine, that the scribes &ldquo;did not, as is generally
supposed, keep their new ideas carefully concealed, so as to leave to
the multitude nothing but coarse superstitions. The contrary is evident
from a number of inscriptions which can be read by anybody, and from
books which anyone can buy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4764src"
href="#xd25e4764" name="xd25e4764src">124</a> But the assumption that
&ldquo;anyone&rdquo; could read or buy books in ancient Egypt is a
serious misconception. Even in our own civilization, where
&ldquo;anyone&rdquo; can presumably buy freethought journals or works
on anthropology and the history of religions, the mass of the people
are so placed that only by chance does such knowledge reach them; and
multitudes are so little cultured that they would pass it by with
uncomprehending indifference were it put before them. In ancient Egypt,
however, the great mass of the people could not even read; and no man
thought of teaching them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">This fact alone goes far to harmonize the ancient
Greek testimonies as to the existence of an esoteric teaching in Egypt
with Tiele&rsquo;s contention to the contrary. See the <i>pros</i> and
<i>cons</i> set forth and confusedly pronounced upon by Professor
Chantepie de la Saussaye, <i>Manual of the Science of Religion</i>,
Eng. tr. pp. 400&ndash;401. We know from Diodorus (i, 81), what we
could deduce from our other knowledge of Egyptian conditions, that,
apart from the priests and the official class, no one received any
literary culture save in some degree the higher grades of artificers,
who needed some little knowledge of letters for their work in
connection with monuments, sepulchres, mummy-cases, and so forth. Cp.
Maspero, <i lang="fr">Hist. anc. des peuples de l&rsquo;orient</i>, p.
285. Even the images of the higher Gods were shown to the people only
on festival-days (Meyer <i lang="de">Gesch. des Alterthums</i>, i,
82).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Egyptian civilization was thus, through all its stages,
obviously conditioned by its material basis, which in turn ultimately
determined its polity, there being no higher contemporary civilization
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>to lead it otherwise. An abundant, cheap, and
regular food supply maintained in perpetuity a dense and
easily-exploited population, whose lot through thousands of years was
toil, ignorance, political subjection, and a primitive mental
life.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4790src" href="#xd25e4790" name=
"xd25e4790src">125</a> For such a population general ideas had no light
and no comfort; for them was the simple human worship of the local
natural Gods or the presiding Gods of the kingdom, alike confusedly
conceived as great powers, figured often as some animal, which for the
primeval mind signified indefinite capacity and unknown possibility of
power and knowledge.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4793src" href=
"#xd25e4793" name="xd25e4793src">126</a> Myths and not theories, magic
and not ethics, were their spiritual food, albeit their peaceful animal
lives conformed sufficiently to their code. And the life-conditions of
the mass determined the policy of priest and king. The enormous
priestly revenue came from the people, and the king&rsquo;s power
rested on both orders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As to this revenue see Diodorus Siculus, i, 73; and
Erman, <i>Handbook of Egyptian Religion</i>, Eng. tr. 1907, p. 71.
According to Diodorus, a third of the whole land of the kingdom was
allotted to the priesthoods. About a sixth of the whole land seems to
have been given to the Gods by Ramessu III alone, besides 113,000
slaves, 490,000 cattle, and immense wealth of other kinds (Flinders
Petrie, <i>Hist. of Egypt</i>, iii (1905), 154&ndash;55). The bulk of
the possessions here enumerated seems to have gone to the temple of
Amen at Thebes and that of the Sun-God at Heliopolis (Erman, as cited).
It is to be noted, however, that the priestly order included all the
physicians, lawyers, clerks, schoolmasters, sculptors, painters, land
measurers, drug sellers, conjurers, diviners, and undertakers.
Wilkinson, <i>Ancient Egyptians</i>, ed. Birch, 1878, i, 157&ndash;58;
Sharpe, <i>Egypt. Mythol.</i> p. 26; Meyer, <i lang="de">Gesch. des
Alt.</i> i, &sect; 68. &ldquo;The sacred domains included herds of
cattle, birds, fishermen, serfs, and temple servants&rdquo; (Flinders
Petrie, as cited, iii, 42). When the revenues assigned for a temple of
Seti I were found to be misappropriated, and the building stopped, his
son, Ramessu II, assigned a double revenue for the completion of the
work and the worship (<i>id.</i>). Like the later priesthood of
Christendom, that of Egypt forged documents to establish claims to
revenue (<i>id.</i> p. 69). Captured cattle in great quantities were
bestowed on temples of Amen (<i>id.</i> p. 149), whose priests were
especially grasping (<i>id.</i> p. 153). Thus in the one reign of
Ramessu III they received fifty-six towns of Egypt and nine of Syria
and 62,000 serfs (<i>id.</i> p. 155).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was fully seen when King Akhunaton (otherwise Echnaton, or
Icheniton, or Akhunaton, or Akhunaten, or Chuenaten, or Khu-en-aten,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>or Kku-n-aten, or Khouniatonou, or Khounaton!) =
Amen-hetep or Amun-hotep (or Amenophis) IV, moved by monotheistic zeal,
departed so far from the customary royal policy as to put under the ban
all deities save that he had chosen for himself, repudiating the
God-name Amen in his own name, and making one from that of his chosen
Sun-God, Aten (&ldquo;the sun&rsquo;s disk&rdquo;) or Aton or
Atonou<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4835src" href="#xd25e4835" name=
"xd25e4835src">127</a> or Iton<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4838src"
href="#xd25e4838" name="xd25e4838src">128</a> (latterly held to be =
the Syrian Adon, &ldquo;the Lord,&rdquo; symbolized by the sun&rsquo;s
disk). There is reason to think that his was not a mere Sun-worship,
but the cult of a deity, &ldquo;Lord of the Disk,&rdquo; who looked
through the sun&rsquo;s disk as through a window.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4841src" href="#xd25e4841" name="xd25e4841src">129</a> In any
interpretation, however, the doctrine was wholly inacceptable to a
priesthood whose multitudinous shrines its success would have emptied.
Of all the host of God-names, by one account only that of the old
Sun-God Ra-Harmachis was spared,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4847src"
href="#xd25e4847" name="xd25e4847src">130</a> as being held identical
with that of Aten; and by one account<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e4854src" href="#xd25e4854" name="xd25e4854src">131</a> the
disaffection of priests and people rose to the point of open rebellion.
At length Akhunaton, &ldquo;Glory of the Disk,&rdquo; as he elected to
name himself, built for himself and his God a new capital city in
Middle Egypt, Akhet-Aten (or Khut-Aten), the modern Tell-el-Amarna,
where he assembled around him a society after his own heart, and
carried on his Aten-worship, while his foreign empire was crumbling.
The &ldquo;Tell-el-Amarna tablets&rdquo; were found in the ruins of his
city, which was deserted a generation after his death. Though the king
enforced his will while he lived, his movement &ldquo;bore no fruit
whatever,&rdquo; his policy being reversed after his family had died
out, and his own monuments and capital city razed to the ground by
orthodox successors.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4860src" href=
"#xd25e4860" name="xd25e4860src">132</a> In the same way the earlier
attempt of the alien Hyksos to suppress the native polytheism and
image-worship had come to nothing.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e4885src"
href="#xd25e4885" name="xd25e4885src">133</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The history of Akhunaton is established by the later
Egyptology. Sharpe makes no mention of it, though the point had been
discussed from 1839 onwards. Cp. Lepsius, <i>Letters from Egypt</i>,
etc., Bohn trans. 1853, p. 27; and Nott and Gliddon&rsquo;s <i>Types of
Mankind</i>, 1854, p. 147, and <i>Indigenous Races of the Earth</i>,
1857, pp. 116&ndash;17, in both of which places <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>will be
found the king&rsquo;s portrait. See last reference for the idle theory
that he had been emasculated, as to which the confutation by Wiedemann
(<i lang="de">Aegyptische Geschichte</i>, p. 397, cited by Budge,
<i>Hist. of Egypt</i>, 1902, iv, 128) is sufficient. In point of fact,
he figures in the monuments as father of three or seven children
(Wiedemann, <i>Rel. of Anc. Eg.</i> p. 37; Erman, p. 69; Budge, iv,
123, 127).</p>
<p>Dispute still reigns as to the origin of the cult to which he
devoted himself. A theory of its nature and derivation, based on that
of Mr. J. H. Breasted (<i>History of Egypt</i>, 1906, p. 396), is set
forth in an article by Mr. A. E. P. Weigall on &ldquo;Religion and
Empire in Ancient Egypt&rdquo; in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, Jan.
1909. On this view Aten or Aton is simply Adon = &ldquo;the
Lord&rdquo;&mdash;a name ultimately identified with Adonis, the Syrian
Sun-God and Vegetation-God. The king&rsquo;s grandfather was apparently
a Syrian, presumably of royal lineage; and Queen Tii or Thiy, the
king&rsquo;s mother, who with her following had wrought a revolution
against the priesthood of Amen, brought him up as a devotee of her own
faith. On her death he became more and more fanatical, getting out of
touch with people and priesthood, so that &ldquo;his empire fell to
pieces rapidly.&rdquo; Letters still exist (among the Tell-el-Amarna
tablets) which were sent by his generals in Asia, vainly imploring
help. He died at the age of twenty-eight; and if the body lately found,
and supposed to be his, is really so, his malady was water on the
brain.</p>
<p>Mr. Breasted, finding that Akhunaton&rsquo;s God is described by him
in inscriptions as &ldquo;the father and the mother of all that he
made,&rdquo; ranks the cult very high in the scale of theism. Mr.
Weigall (art. cited, p. 60; so also Budge, <i>Hist.</i> iv, 125)
compares a hymn of the king&rsquo;s with <a class="biblink xd25e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%20104:24&amp;version=NRSV">
Ps. civ, 24</a> <i>sq.</i>, and praises it accordingly. The parallel is
certainly close, but the document is not thereby certificated as
philosophic. On the strength of the fact that Akhunaton &ldquo;had
dreamed that the Aton religion would bind the nations together,&rdquo;
Mr. Weigall credits him with harbouring &ldquo;an illusive ideal
towards which, thirty-two centuries later, mankind is still struggling
in vain&rdquo; (p. 66). The ideal of subjugating the nations to one
God, cherished later by Jews, and still later by Moslems, is hardly to
be thus identified with the modern ideal of international peace.
Brugsch, in turn, credits the king with having &ldquo;willingly
received the teaching about the one God of Light,&rdquo; while
admitting that Aten simply meant the sun&rsquo;s disk (<i>Hist. of
Egypt</i>, 1-vol. ed. p. 216).</p>
<p>Maspero, again, declares Tii to have been an Egyptian of old stock,
and the God &ldquo;Atonou&rdquo; to have been the deity of her tribe
(<i>Hist. anc.</i>, as cited, p. 249); and he pronounces the cult
probably the most ancient variant of the religions of Ra (p. 250).
Messrs. King and Hall, who also do not accept the theory of a Syrian
derivation, coincide with Messrs. Breasted and Weigall <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>in
extolling Akhunaton&rsquo;s creed. In a somewhat summary fashion they
pronounce (work cited, p. 383) that, &ldquo;given an ignorance of the
true astronomical character of the sun, we see how eminently rational a
religion&rdquo; was this. The conception of a moving window in the
heavens, which appears to be the core of it, seems rather a darkening
than a development of the &ldquo;philosophical speculations of the
priests of the Sun at Heliopolis,&rdquo; from which it is held by
Messrs. King and Hall to have been derived. Similarly ill-warranted is
the decision (<i>id.</i> p. 384) that in Akhunaton&rsquo;s heresy
&ldquo;we see &hellip; the highest attitude [? altitude] to which
religious ideas had attained before the days of the Hebrew
prophets.&rdquo; Alike in India and in Egypt, pantheistic ideas of a
larger scope than his or those of the Hebrew prophets had been attained
before Akhunaton&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge, on the other hand, points out that the cult
of the Aten is really an ancient one in Egypt, and was carried on by
Thothmes III, father of Amen-hetep II, a century before Akhunaton
(Amen-hetep IV), its &ldquo;original home&rdquo; being Heliopolis
(<i>History of Egypt</i>, 1902, iv, 48, 119). So also von Bissing,
<i lang="de">Gesch. Aeg. in Umriss</i>, p. 52 (reading
&ldquo;Iton&rdquo;). Rejecting the view that &ldquo;Aten&rdquo; is only
a form of &ldquo;Adon,&rdquo; Dr. Budge pronounces that &ldquo;as far
as can be seen now the worship of Aten was something like a glorified
materialism&rdquo;&mdash;whatever that may be&mdash;&ldquo;which had to
be expounded by priests who performed ceremonies similar to those which
belonged to the old Heliopolitan sun-worship, without any connection
whatsoever with the worship of Yahweh; and a being of the character of
the Semitic God Ad&ocirc;n had no place in it anywhere.&rdquo; Further,
he considers that it &ldquo;contained no doctrines on the unity or
oneness of Aten similar to those which are found in the hymns to
R&#257;, and none of the beautiful ideas on the future life with which
we are familiar from the hymns and other compositions in the <i>Book of
the Dead</i>&rdquo; (<i>Ib.</i> pp. 120&ndash;21).</p>
<p>By Prof. Flinders Petrie Queen Tii or Thiy is surmised to have been
of Armenian origin (see Budge, iv, 96&ndash;98, as to her being
&ldquo;Mesopotamian&rdquo;); and Prof. Petrie, like Mr. Breasted, has
inferred that she brought with her the cult of which her son became the
devotee. (So also Brugsch, p. 214.) Messrs. King and Hall recognize
that the cult had made some headway before Akhunaton took it up; but
deny that there is any reason for supposing Queen Tii to have been of
foreign origin; adding: &ldquo;It seems undoubted that the Aten cult
was a development of pure Egyptian religious thought.&rdquo; Certainty
on such an issue seems hardly possible; but it may be said, as against
the theory of a foreign importation, that there is no evidence whatever
of any high theistic cult of Adonis in Syria at the period in question.
Adonis was primarily a Vegetation-God; and the older view that Aten
simply means &ldquo;the sun&rsquo;s disk&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>is
hardly disposed of. It is noteworthy that under Akhunaton&rsquo;s
patronage Egyptian sculpture enjoyed a term of freedom from the
paralyzing convention which reigned before and after (King and Hall, as
cited, pp. 383&ndash;84). This seems to have been the result of the
innovating taste of the king (Budge, <i>Hist.</i> iv,
124&ndash;26).</p>

person;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5030src" href="#xd25e5030" name=

of the sects were the due duplication of the older strifes between the
worshippers of the various sacred animals in the several
cities.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5036src" href="#xd25e5036" name=

clay to take the impress of the Arab conquerors, with their new fanatic

<p>For the rest, the higher forms of the ancient religion had been able
to hold their own till they were absolutely suppressed, with the
philosophic schools, by the Byzantine government, which at the same
time marked the end of the ancient civilization by destroying or
scattering the vast collection of books in the Serapeion, annihilating
at once the last pagan cult and the stored treasure of pagan culture.
With that culture too, however, there had been associated to the last
the boundless credulity which had so long kept it company. In the
second century of our era, under the Antonines, we have Apuleius
telling of Isis worshipped as &ldquo;Nature, parent of things, mistress
of all elements, the primordial birth of the ages, highest of
divinities, queen of departed spirits, first of the heavenly ones, the
single manifestation of all Gods and Goddesses,&rdquo; who rules all
things in earth and heaven, and who stands for the sole deity

even the subtle philosophy of the Alexandrian Neo-Platonic school did
not discard. All alike, with the machinery of exorcism, were passed on
to the worship of the Christian Queen of Heaven, leaving out only the
pantheism; and when that worship in turn was overthrown, the One God of
Islam enrolled in his train the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of the inner workings of thought in the Phoenician
religion we know even less, directly, than can be gathered as to any
other ancient system of similar notoriety,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5069src" href="#xd25e5069" name="xd25e5069src">148</a> so
completely did the Roman conquest of Carthage, and the Macedonian
conquest of Tyre and Sidon, blot out the literary remains of their
peoples. Yet there are some indirect clues of a remarkable sort.</p>
<p>It is hardly to be doubted, in the first place, that Punic
speculation took the same main lines as the early thought of Egypt and
Mesopotamia, whose cultures, mixing in Syria as early as the fifteenth
century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, had laid the basis of the later
Phoenician civilization.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5080src" href=
"#xd25e5080" name="xd25e5080src">149</a> The simple fact that among the
Syro-Phoenicians was elaborated the alphabet adopted by all the later
civilizations of the West almost implies a special measure of
intellectual progress. We can indeed trace the normal movement of
syncretism in the cults, and the normal tendency to improve their
ethics. The theory of an original pure monotheism<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5083src" href="#xd25e5083" name="xd25e5083src">150</a> is no more
tenable here than anywhere else; we can see that the general
designation of the chief God of any city, usually recognizable as a
Sun-God, by a title rather than a name,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5089src" href="#xd25e5089" name="xd25e5089src">151</a> though it
pointed to a general worship of a pre-eminent power, in no sense
excluded a belief in minor powers, ranking even as deities. It did not
do so in the admittedly polytheistic period; and it cannot therefore be
supposed to have done so previously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The chief Phoenician Gods, it is admitted, were
everywhere called by one or several of the titles Baal (Lord), Ram or
Rimmon (High), Melech or Molech (King), Melkarth (King of the City),
Eliun (Supreme), Adonai (Lord), Bel-Samin (Lord of Heaven), etc. (Cp.
Rawlinson, <i>History of Phoenicia</i>, p. 231; Tiele, <i lang=
"fr">Hist. comp. des anc. relig.</i>, etc., Fr. tr. 1882, ch. iii, pp.
281&ndash;87; <i>Outlines</i>, p. 82; Meyer, <i lang="de">Gesch. des
Alt.</i> i, 246, and art. &ldquo;<span class=
"sc">Phoenicia</span>&rdquo; in <i>Encyc. Biblica</i>, iii,
3742&ndash;5; Sayce, <i>Ancient Empires</i>, p. 200.) The just
inference is that the Sun-God was generally worshipped, the sun being
for the Semitic peoples the pre-eminent Nature-power. &ldquo;He alone
of all the Gods is by Philo explained not as a deified man, but as the
sun, who had been invoked from the earliest times&rdquo; (Meyer, last
cit.). (All Gods were not Baals: the division between <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>them and
lesser powers corresponded somewhat, as Tiele notes, to that between
Theoi and Daimones with the Greeks, and Ases and Vanes with the old
Scandinavians. So in Babylonia and India the Bels and Asuras were
marked off from lesser deities.) The fact that the Western Semites thus
carried with them the worship of their chief deities in all their
colonies would seem to make an end of the assumption (Gomme,
<i>Ethnology of Folklore</i>, p. 68; Menzies, <i>History of
Religion</i>, pp. 284, 250) that there is something specially
&ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; in the &ldquo;conception of Gods who could and did
accompany the tribes wheresoever they travelled.&rdquo; Cp. Meyer,
<i lang="de">Gesch. des Alt.</i> iii, 169.</p>
<p>The worship of the Baal, however, being that of a special
Nature-power, cannot in early any more than in later times have been
monotheistic. What happened was a preponderance of the double cult of
the God and Goddess, Baal and Ashtoreth, as in the unquestionably
polytheistic period (Rawlinson, p. 323; Tiele, <i>Hist. Comp.</i>, as
cited, p. 319).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from this normal tendency to identify Gods called by the same
title (a state of things which, however, in ancient as in modern
Catholic countries, tended at the same time to set up special adoration
of a given image), there is seen in the later religion of Phoenicia a
spirit of syncretism which operated in a manner the reverse of that
seen in later Jewry. In the latter case the national God was ultimately
conceived, however fanatically, as universal, all others being negated:
in commercial Phoenicia, many foreign Gods were adopted,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5136src" href="#xd25e5136" name=
"xd25e5136src">152</a> the tendency being finally to conceive them as
all manifestations of one Power.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5148src"
href="#xd25e5148" name="xd25e5148src">153</a> And there is reason to
suppose that in the cosmopolitan world of the Phoenician cities the
higher intelligence reached a yet more subversive, though still
fallacious, theory of religion. The pretended ancient Phoenician
cosmogony of Sanchoniathon, preserved by Eusebius,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e5160src" href="#xd25e5160" name="xd25e5160src">154</a> while
worthless as a record of the most ancient beliefs,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e5165src" href="#xd25e5165" name="xd25e5165src">155</a> may be
taken as representing views current not only in the time and society of
Philo of Byblos (100 <span class="sc">C.E.</span>), who had pretended
to translate it, but in a period considerably earlier. This cosmogony
is, as Eusebius complains, deliberately atheistic; and it further
systematically explains away all God stories as being originally true
of remarkable men.</p>
<p>Where this primitive form of atheistic rationalism originated we
cannot now tell. But it was in some form current before the time of the
Greek Ev&ecirc;meros, who systematically developed it about
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>300 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>; for in a
monotheistic application it more or less clearly underlies the
redaction of much of the Hebrew Bible, where both patriarchal and regal
names of the early period are found to be old God-names; and where the
Sun-God Samson is made a &ldquo;judge&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5178src" href="#xd25e5178" name=
"xd25e5178src">156</a>&mdash;having originally been the Judge-God. In
the Byblian writer, however, the purpose is not monotheistic, but
atheistic; and the problem is whether this or that was the earlier
development of the method. The natural presumption seems to be that the
Hebrew adaptors of the old mythology used an already applied method, as
the Christian Fathers later used the work of Ev&ecirc;meros; and the
citation from Thallos by Lactantius<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5181src"
href="#xd25e5181" name="xd25e5181src">157</a> suggests that the method
had been applied in Chaldea, as it was spontaneously applied by the
Greek epic poets who made memorable mortals out of the ancient deities
Odysseus and <span class="corr" id="xd25e5186" title=
"Source: Aeneas">&AElig;neas</span>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5190src" href="#xd25e5190" name="xd25e5190src">158</a> Helen,
Castor and Pollux, Achilles, and many more.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5196src" href="#xd25e5196" name="xd25e5196src">159</a> It is in
any case credible enough that among the much-travelling Phoenicians,
with their open pantheon, an atheistic Ev&ecirc;merism was thought out
by the skeptical types before Ev&ecirc;meros; and that the latter
really drew his principles from Phoenicia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5221src" href="#xd25e5221" name="xd25e5221src">160</a> At any
rate, they were there received, doubtless by a select few, as a means
of answering the customary demand for &ldquo;something in place
of&rdquo; the rejected Gods. Concerning the tradition that an ancient
Phoenician, Moschus, had sketched an atomic theory, we may again say
that, though there is no valid evidence for the statement, it counts
for something as proof that the Phoenicians had an old repute for
rationalism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Byblian cosmogony may be conceived as an atheistic
refinement on those of Babylon, adopted by the Jews. It connects with
the theogony ascribed to Hesiod (which has Asiatic aspects), in that
both begin with Chaos, and the Gods of Hesiod are born later. But
whereas in Hesiod Chaos brings forth Erebos and Night (Eros being
causal force), and Night bears &AElig;ther and Day to Erebos, while
Earth virginally brings forth Heaven (Uranos) and the Sea, and then
bears the first Gods in union with Heaven, the Phoenician fragment
proceeds from black chaos and wind, after long ages, through Eros or
Desire, to a kind of primeval slime, from which arise first
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>animals without intelligence, who in turn produce
some with intelligence. The effort to expel Deity must have been
considerable, for sun and moon and stars seem to arise uncreated, and
the sun&rsquo;s action spontaneously produces further developments. The
first man and his wife are created by male and female principles of
wind, and their offspring proceed to worship the Sun, calling him Beel
Samin. The other Gods are explained as eminent mortals deified after
their death. See the details in Cory&rsquo;s <i>Ancient Fragments</i>,
Hodges&rsquo; ed. pp. 1&ndash;22. As to Moschus, cp. Renouvier,
<i lang="fr">Manuel de philos. ancienne</i>, 1844, i, 238; and
Mosheim&rsquo;s ed. of Cudworth&rsquo;s <i>Intellectual System</i>,
Harrison&rsquo;s tr. i, 20; also Cudworth&rsquo;s <i>Eternal and
Immutable Morality</i>, same ed. iii, 548. On the general question of
Phoenician rationalism, compare Pausanias&rsquo;s account (vii, 23) of
his discussion with a Sidonian, who explained that Apollo was simply
the sun, and his son &AElig;sculapius simply the healing art.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time there are signs even in Phoenician worship of an
effort after an ethical as well as an intellectual purification of the
common religion. To call &ldquo;the&rdquo; Phoenician religion
&ldquo;impure and cruel&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5247src"
href="#xd25e5247" name="xd25e5247src">161</a> is to obscure the fact
that in all civilizations certain types and cults vary from the norm.
In Phoenicia as in Israel there were humane anti-sensualists who either
avoided or impugned the sensual and the cruel cults around them; as
well as ascetics who stood by human sacrifice while resisting sexual
licence. That the better types remained the minority is to be
understood in terms of the balance of the social and cultural forces of
their civilization, not of any racial bias or defect, intellectual or
moral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The remark of E. Meyer (<i lang="de">Gesch. des
Alt.</i> i, 211, &sect; 175), that an ethical or mystical conception of
the God was &ldquo;entirely alien&rdquo; to &ldquo;the Semite,&rdquo;
reproduces the old fallacy of definite race-characters; and Mr. Sayce,
in remarking that &ldquo;the immorality performed in the name of
religion was the invention of the Semitic race itself&rdquo; (<i>Anc.
Emp.</i> p. 203; contrast Tiele, <i>Outlines</i>, p. 83), after
crediting the Semitic race with an ethical faculty alien to the
Akkadian (above, p. 66), suggests another phase of the same error.
There is nothing special to the Semites in the case save degree of
development, similar phenomena being found in many savage religions, in
Mexico, and in India. (Meyer in later passages and in his article on
Ba&rsquo;al in Boscher&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Lexikon</i> modifies his
position as to Semitic <i>versus</i> other religions.) On the other
hand, there was a chaste as well as an unchaste worship of the
Phoenician Ashtoreth. Ashtoreth Karnaim, or Tanit, the Virgin, as
opposed to Atergates and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href=
"#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>Annit, the Mother-Goddesses, had the
characteristics of Artemis. Cp. Tiele, <i lang="fr">Religion
compar&eacute;e</i>, as cited, pp. 318&ndash;19; Menzies, <i>History of
Religion</i>, pp. 159, 168&ndash;71; Kuenen, <i>Religion of Israel</i>,
i, 91; Smith, <i>Religion of the Semites</i>, pp. 292, 458. [In Rome,
Venus Cloacina, sometimes ignorantly described as a Goddess of Vice,
was anciently &ldquo;the Goddess of chaste and holy matrimony&rdquo;
(Ettore Pais, <i>Ancient Legends of Roman History</i>, Eng. tr. 1906,
p. 199)]. For the rest, the cruelty of the Phoenician cults, in the
matter of human sacrifice, was fully paralleled among the early
Teutons. See Tiele, <i>Outlines</i>, p. 199; and the author&rsquo;s
<i>Pagan Christs</i>, Pt. ii, ch. i, &sect; 4.</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 7. <i>Ancient China</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of all the ancient Asiatic systems that of China
yields us the first clear biographical trace of a practical
rationalist, albeit a rationalist stamped somewhat by Chinese
conservatism. Confucius (<i>Kung-fu-tse</i> = Kung the Master) is a
tangible person, despite some mythic accretions, whereas Zarathustra
and Buddha are at best but doubtful possibilities, and even Lao-Tsze
(said to have been born 604 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>) is somewhat
elusive.</p>
<p>Before Confucius (551&ndash;478 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>), it is
evident, there had been a slackening in religious belief among the
governing classes. It is claimed for the Chinese, as for so many other
races, that they had anciently a &ldquo;pure&rdquo;
monotheism;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5315src" href="#xd25e5315" name=
"xd25e5315src">162</a> but the ascription, as usual, is misleading.
They saw in the expanse of heaven the &ldquo;Supreme&rdquo; Power, not
as a result of reflection on the claims of other deities among other
races, but simply as expressing their primordial tribal recognition of
that special God, before contact with the God-ideas of other peoples.
Monotheistic in the modern sense they could not be. Concerning them as
concerning the Semites we may say that the claim of a primary
monotheism for them &ldquo;is also true of all primitive totemistic or
clannish communities. A man is born into a community with such a divine
head, and the worship of that God is the only one possible to
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5324src" href="#xd25e5324" name=
"xd25e5324src">163</a> Beside the belief in the Heaven-God, there stood
beliefs in heavenly and earthly spirits, and in ancestors, who were
worshipped with altars.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5330src" href=
"#xd25e5330" name="xd25e5330src">164</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The remark of Professor Legge (<i>Religions of
China</i>, p. 11), that the relation of the names Shang-Ti = Supreme
Ruler, and T&rsquo;ien = the sky, &ldquo;has kept the monotheistic
element prominent in the religion proper of China <i>down to the
present time</i>,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>may serve to avert disputation. It
may be agreed that the Chinese were anciently &ldquo;monotheists&rdquo;
in the way in which they are at present, when they worship spirits
innumerable. When, however, Professor Legge further says (p. 16) that
the ancient monotheism five thousand years ago was &ldquo;in danger of
being corrupted&rdquo; by nature worship and divination, he puts in
doubt the meaning of the other expression above cited. He states
several times (pp. 46, 51, 52) that the old monotheism remains; but
speaks (p. 84) of the mass of the people as &ldquo;cut off from the
worship of God for themselves.&rdquo; And see p. 91 as to
ancestor-worship by the Emperor. Tiele (<i>Outlines</i>, p. 27) in
comparison somewhat overstresses the polytheistic aspect of the Chinese
religion in his opening definition; but he adds the essential facts.
Dr. Legge&rsquo;s remark that &ldquo;the idea of revelation did not
shock&rdquo; the ancient Chinese (p. 13) is obscure. He is dealing with
the ordinary Akkado-Babylonian astrology. Pauthier, on the contrary
(<i lang="fr">Chine Moderne</i>, 1853, p. 250), asserts that in China
&ldquo;no doctrine has ever been put forth as revealed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As regards ancestral worship, we have record of a display of
disregard for it by the lords of L&ucirc; in Confucius&rsquo;s
time;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5356src" href="#xd25e5356" name=
"xd25e5356src">165</a> and the general attitude of Confucius himself,
religious only in his adherence to old ceremonies, is incompatible with
a devout environment. It has been disputed whether he makes a
&ldquo;skeptic denial of any relation between man and a living
God&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5362src" href="#xd25e5362" name=
"xd25e5362src">166</a> but an authority who disputes this complains
that his &ldquo;avoiding the personal name of T&icirc;, or God, and
only using the more indefinite term Heaven,&rdquo; suggests &ldquo;a
coldness of temperament and intellect in the matter of
religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5365src" href="#xd25e5365"
name="xd25e5365src">167</a> He was, indeed, above all things a
moralist; and concerning the spirits in general he taught that
&ldquo;To give one&rsquo;s self to the duties due to men, and, while
respecting spiritual beings, to keep aloof from them, may be called
wisdom.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5370src" href="#xd25e5370"

"noteref" id="xd25e5386src" href="#xd25e5386" name=

"xd25e5392src">171</a> &ldquo;I would say,&rdquo; writes Dr. Legge (who
never forgets to be a missionary), &ldquo;that he was unreligious
rather than irreligious; yet, by the coldness of his temperament and
intellect in this matter, his influence is unfavourable to the
development of true religious feeling among the Chinese people
generally, and he prepared the way for the speculations of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>the
literati of medieval and modern times, which have exposed them to the
charge of atheism.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5400src" href=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The view that there was a very early &ldquo;arrest of
growth&rdquo; in the Chinese religion (Menzies, <i>History of
Religion</i>, p. 108), &ldquo;before the ordinary developments of
<i>mythology</i> and doctrine, priesthood,&rdquo; etc., had &ldquo;time
to take place,&rdquo; is untenable as to the mythology. The same writer
had previously spoken (p. 107) of the Chinese system before Confucius
as having &ldquo;already <i>parted with</i> all savage and irrational
elements.&rdquo; That Confucius would seek to eliminate these seems
likely enough, though the documentary fact is disputed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the elder contemporary of Confucius, Lao-Tsze (&ldquo;Old
Philosopher&rdquo;), the founder of Taouism, may be recognized another
and more remarkable early freethinker of a different stamp, in some
essential respects much less conservative, and in intellectual cast
markedly more original. Where Confucius was an admirer and student of
antiquity, Lao-Tsze expressly put such concern aside,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e5421src" href="#xd25e5421" name="xd25e5421src">173</a> seeking
a law of life within himself, in a manner suggestive of much Indian and
other Oriental thought. So far as our records go, he is the first known
philosopher who denied that men could form an idea of deity, that being
the infinite; and he avowedly evolved, by way of makeshift, the idea of
a primordial and governing Reason (<i>Tau</i>), closely analogous to
the <i>Logos</i> of later Platonism. Since the same idea is traceable
in more primitive forms alike in the Babylonian and Brahmanic
systems,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5430src" href="#xd25e5430" name=
"xd25e5430src">174</a> it is arguable that he may have derived it from
one of these sources; but the problem is very obscure. In any case, his
system is one of rationalistic pantheism.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5436src" href="#xd25e5436" name="xd25e5436src">175</a></p>
<p>His personal relation to Confucius was that of a self-poised sage,
impatient of the other&rsquo;s formalism and regard to prescription and
precedent. Where they compare is in their avoidance of supernaturalism,
and in the sometimes singular rationality of their views of social
science; in which latter respect, however, they were the recipients and
transmitters of an already classic tradition.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5456src" href="#xd25e5456" name="xd25e5456src">176</a> Thus both
had a strong bias to conservatism; and in Lao-Tsze it went the length
of prescribing that the people should not be instructed.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5462src" href="#xd25e5462" name=
"xd25e5462src">177</a> Despite this, it is not going too far to say
that no ancient people appears to have produced sane thinkers and
scientific <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>moralists earlier than the Chinese. The Golden
Rule, repeatedly formulated by Confucius, seems to be but a
condensation on his part of doctrine he found in the older
classics;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5467src" href="#xd25e5467" name=
"xd25e5467src">178</a> and as against Lao-Tsze he is seen maintaining
the practical form of the principle of reciprocity. The older man, like
some later teachers, preached the rule of returning kindness for
evil,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5473src" href="#xd25e5473" name=
"xd25e5473src">179</a> without leaving any biographical trace of such
practice on his own part. Confucius, dealing with human nature as it
actually is, argued that evil should be met by justice, and kindness
with kindness, else the evil were as much fostered as the
good.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5479src" href="#xd25e5479" name=
"xd25e5479src">180</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is to be regretted that Christian writers should
keep up the form of condemning Confucius (so Legge, <i>Religions of
China</i>, p. 144; <i>Life and Teachings of Confucius</i>, 4th ed. p.
111 <i>sq.</i>; Douglas, p. 144) for a teaching the practice of which
is normally possible, and is never transcended in their own Church,
where the profession of returning good for evil merely constitutes one
of the great hypocrisies of civilization. Dr. Legge does not scruple to
resort to a bad sophism in this connection. &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;we only do good to them that do good to us, what reward have
we?&rdquo; He thus insinuates that Confucius vetoed any
<i>spontaneous</i> act of benevolence. The question is not of such
acts, but of kind acts to those who seek to injure us. On the other
hand, Mr. Chalmers, who dedicates his translation of Lao-Tsze to Dr.
Legge, actually taunts Lao-Tsze (p. 38) with absurdity in respect of
<i>his</i> doctrine. Such is the sincerity of orthodox polemic. How
little effect the self-abnegating teaching of Lao-Tsze, in turn, has
had on <i>his</i> followers may be gathered from their very legends
concerning him (Douglas, p. 182). There is a fallacy, further, in the
Christian claim that Confucius (<i>Analects</i>, v, 11; xv, 23) put the
Golden Rule in a lower form than that of the Gospels, in that he gave
it the negative form, &ldquo;Do <i>not</i> that which ye would
<i>not</i> have done unto you.&rdquo; This is really the rational and
valid form of the Rule. The positive form, unless construed in the
restrictive sense, would merely prescribe a non-moral doing of favours
in the hope of receiving favours in return. It appears, further, from
the passage in the <i>Analects</i>, v, 11, that the doctrine in this
form was familiar before Confucius.</p>

<p>Lao-Tsze, on his part, had reduced religion to a minimum.
&ldquo;There is not a word in the T&acirc;o T&ecirc;h King [by
Lao-Tsze] of the sixth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span> that
savours either of superstition or religion.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=

Lao-Tsze and the practicality of Confucius alike failed to check the
growth of superstition among the ever-increasing ignorant Chinese
population. Says our Christian authority: &ldquo;In the works of
Lieh-Tsze and Chwang-Tsze, followers of Lao-Tsze, two or three
centuries later, we find abundance of grotesque superstition, though we
are never sure how far those writers really believed the things they
relate.&rdquo; In point of fact, Lieh-Tsze is now commonly held by
scholars to be an imaginary personage, whose name is given to a
miscellaneous collection of teachings and moral tales, much
interpolated and added to long after the date assigned to
him&mdash;<i>circa</i> 400 <span class="sc">B.C.</span><a class=

maintain a fixed heart. As to the people, if they have not a certain

cheap food, at a low standard of comfort, and in a state of utter
ignorance. Hence the cult of Confucius was maintained among them only
by recognizing their normal superstition; but on that basis it has
remained secure, despite competition, and even a term of early
persecution. One iconoclastic emperor, the founder of the Ch&rsquo;in
or Ts&rsquo;in dynasty (221 or 212 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>),
sought to extirpate Confucianism as a means to a revolution in the
government; but the effort came to nothing.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Nowhere, perhaps, is our sociological lesson more clearly to be read
than in China. Centuries before our era it had a rationalistic
literature, an ethic no less earnest and far more sane that that of the
Hebrews, and a line of known teachers as remarkable in their way as
those of ancient Greece who flourished about the same period. But where
even Greece, wrought upon by all the other cultures of antiquity,
ultimately retrograded, till under Christianity it stayed at a Chinese
level of unprogressiveness for a thousand years, isolated China, helped
by no neighbouring culture adequate to the need, has stagnated as
regards the main mass of its life, despite some political <span class=

<h3 class="main">&sect; 8. <i>Mexico and Peru</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the religions of pre-Christian Mexico and Peru we
have peculiarly interesting examples of &ldquo;early&rdquo; religious
systems, flourishing at some such culture-level as the ancient
Akkadian, in full play at the time of the European Renaissance. In
Mexico a partly &ldquo;high&rdquo; ethical code, as the phrase goes,
went concurrently with the most frightful indulgence in human
sacrifice, sustained by the continuous practice of indecisive war for
the securing of captives, and by the interest of a vast priesthood. In
this system had been developed all the leading features of those of the
Old World&mdash;the identification of all the Gods with the Sun; the
worship of fire, and the annual renewal of it by special means; the
conception of God-sacrifice and of communion with the God by the act of
eating his slain representative; the belief in a Virgin-Mother-Goddess;
the connection of humanitarian ethic with the divine command; the
opinion that celibacy, as a state of superior virtue, is incumbent on
most priests and on all would-be saints; the substitution of a
sacramental bread for the &ldquo;body and blood&rdquo; of the God-Man;
the idea of an interceding Mother-Goddess; the hope of a coming
Saviour; the regular practice of prayer; exorcism, special indulgences,
confession, absolution, fasting, and so on.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5679src" href="#xd25e5679" name="xd25e5679src">199</a> In Peru,
also, many of those conceptions were in force; but the limitation of
the power and numbers of the priesthood by the imperial system of the
Incas, and the state of peace normal in their dominions, prevented the
Mexican development of human sacrifice.</p>
<p>It seems probable that the Toltecs, who either fled before or were
for the most part subdued or destroyed by the barbarian Chichimecs (in
turn subdued by the Aztecs) a few centuries before Cortes, were on the
whole a less warlike and more civilized people, with a less bloody
worship.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5687src" href="#xd25e5687" name=
"xd25e5687src">200</a> Their God, Quetzalcoatl, retained through fear
by the Aztecs,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5696src" href="#xd25e5696"
name="xd25e5696src">201</a> was a comparatively benign deity opposed to
human <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>sacrifice, apparently rather a late purification
or partial rationalization of an earlier God-type than a primitively
harmless conception.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5704src" href=
"#xd25e5704" name="xd25e5704src">202</a> Insofar as they were sundered
by quarrels between the sectaries of the God Quetzalcoatl and the God
Votan, though their religious wars seem to have been as cruel as those
of the early Christians of North Africa, there appears to have been at
work among them a movement towards unbloody religion. In any case their
overthrow seems to stand for the military inferiority of the higher and
more rational civilization<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5716src" href=
"#xd25e5716" name="xd25e5716src">203</a> to the lower and more
religious, which in turn, however, was latterly being destroyed by its
enormously burdensome military and priestly system, and may even be
held to have been ruined by its own superstitious fears.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5720src" href="#xd25e5720" name=
"xd25e5720src">204</a></p>
<p>Among the recognizable signs of normal progress in the ordinary
Aztec religion were (1) the general recognition of the Sun as the God
really worshipped in all the temples of the deities with special
names;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5725src" href="#xd25e5725" name=
"xd25e5725src">205</a> (2) the substitution in some cults of baked
bread-images for a crucified human victim. The question arises whether
the Aztecs, but for their overwhelming priesthood, might conceivably
have risen above their system of human sacrifices, as the Aryan Hindus
had done in an earlier age. Their material civilization, which carried
on that of the kindred Toltecs, was at several points superior to that
which the Spaniards put in its place; and their priesthood, being a
leisured and wealthy class, might have developed intellectually as did
the Brahmans,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5737src" href="#xd25e5737"
name="xd25e5737src">206</a> if its economic basis had been changed. But
only a conquest or other great political convulsion could conceivably
have overturned the vast cultus of human sacrifice, which overran all
life, and cherished war as a means of procuring victims.</p>
<p>In the kindred State of Tezcuco, civilization seems to have gone
further than in Aztec Anahuac; and about the middle of the fifteenth
century one Tezcucan king, the conqueror Netzahualcoyotl, who has left
writings in both prose and verse, is seen attaining to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>something like a philosophic creed, of a
monotheistic stamp.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5753src" href=
"#xd25e5753" name="xd25e5753src">207</a> He is said to have rejected
all idol-worship, and erected, as aforesaid, an altar &ldquo;to the
Unknown God,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5762src" href=
"#xd25e5762" name="xd25e5762src">208</a> forbidding all sacrifices of
blood in that worship. But among the Tezcucans these never ceased;
three hundred slaves were sacrificed at the obsequies of the
conqueror&rsquo;s son, Netzahualpilli; and the Aztec influence over the
superior civilization was finally complete.</p>
<p>In Peru, again, we find civilization advancing in respect of the
innovation of substituting statuettes for wives and slaves in the tombs
of the rich; and we have already noted<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5767src" href="#xd25e5767" name="xd25e5767src">209</a> the
remarkable records of the avowed unbelief of several Incas in the
divinity of the nationally worshipped Sun. For the rest, there was the
dubious quasi-monotheistic cult of the Creator-God, Pachacamac,
concerning whom every fresh discussion raises fresh doubt.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5770src" href="#xd25e5770" name=
"xd25e5770src">210</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Mr. Lang, as usual, leans to the view that Pachacamac
stands for a primordial and &ldquo;elevated&rdquo; monotheism
(<i>Making of Religion</i>, pp. 263&ndash;70), while admitting the
slightness of the evidence. Garcilasso, the most eminent authority,
who, however, is contradicted by others, represents that the conception
of Pachacamac as Creator, needing no temple or sacrifice, was
&ldquo;philosophically&rdquo; reached by the Incas and their wise men
(Lang, p. 262). The historical fact seems to be that a race subdued by
the Incas, the Yuncas, had one temple to this deity; and that the Incas
adopted the cult. Garcilasso says the Yuncas had human sacrifices and
idols, which the Incas abolished, setting up their monotheistic cult in
that one temple. This is sufficiently unlikely; and it may very well
have been the fact that the Yuncas had offered no sacrifices. But if
they did not, it was because their material conditions, like those of
the Australians and Fuegians, had not facilitated the practice; and in
that case their &ldquo;monotheism&rdquo; likewise would merely
represent the ignorant simplicity of a clan-cult. (Compare Tylor,
<i>Primitive Culture</i>, ii, 335 sq.; Brinton, <i>Myths of the New
World</i>, p. 52.) On the other hand, <i>if</i> the Incas had set up a
cult without sacrifices to a so-called One God, their idea <i>would</i>
be philosophical, as taking into account the multitude of clan-cults as
well as their own national worships, and transcending these.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the outstanding sociological fact in Incarial Peru was the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>absolute subjection of the mass of the people; and
though its material development and political organization were
comparable to those of ancient Persia under the Akhamenid&aelig;, so
that the Spanish Conquest stood here for mere destruction, there is no
reason to think that at the best its intellectual life could have risen
higher than that of pre-Alexandrian Egypt, to which it offers so many
resemblances. The Incas&rsquo; schools were for the nobility
only.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5799src" href="#xd25e5799" name=
"xd25e5799src">211</a> Rationalistic Incas and high priests might have
ruled over a docile, unlettered multitude, gradually softening their
moral code, in connection with their rather highly-developed doctrine
(resembling the Egyptian) of a future state. But these seem the natural
limits, in the absence of contact with another civilization not too
disparate for a fruitful union.</p>
<p>In Mexico, on the other hand, an interaction of native cultures had
already occurred to some purpose; and the strange humanitarianism of
the man-slaying priests, who made free public hospitals of part of
their blood-stained temples,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5804src" href=
"#xd25e5804" name="xd25e5804src">212</a> suggests a possibility of
esoteric mental culture among them. They had certainly gone relatively
far in their moral code, as apart from their atrocious creed of
sacrifice, even if we discount the testimony of the benevolent priest
Sahagun;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5810src" href="#xd25e5810" name=
"xd25e5810src">213</a> and they had the beginnings of a system of
education for the middle classes.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5818src"
href="#xd25e5818" name="xd25e5818src">214</a> But unless one of the
States which habitually warred for captives should have conquered the
others&mdash;in which case a strong ruler might have put an end to the
wholesale religious slaughter of his own subjects, as appears to have
been done anciently in Mesopotamia&mdash;the priests in all likelihood
would never have transcended their hideous hallucination of sacrifice.
Their murdered civilization is thus the &ldquo;great perhaps&rdquo; of
sociology; organized religion being the most sinister factor in the
problem.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">&sect; 9. <i>The Common Forces of
Degeneration</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is implied more or less in all the foregoing
summaries that there is an inherent tendency in all systematized and
instituted religion to degenerate intellectually and morally, save for
the constant corrective activity of freethought. It may be well,
however, to note specifically the forms or phases of the tendency.</p>
<p>1. Dogmatic and ritual religion being, to begin with, a more or less
general veto on fresh thinking, it lies in its nature that the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>religious person is as such less intelligently
alive to all problems of thought and conduct than he otherwise might
be&mdash;a fact which at least outweighs, in a whole society, the gain
from imposing a terrorized conformity on the less well-biassed types.
Wherever conduct is a matter of sheer obedience to a superhuman code,
it is <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> uncritical and unprogressive. Thus
the history of most religions is a record of declines and reformations,
each new affirmation of moral freethought <i lang="la">ad hoc</i> being
in turn erected into a set of sheer commands. To set up the necessary
ferment of corrective thought even for a time, there seems to be needed
(<i>a</i>) a provocation to the intelligence, as in the spectacle of
conflict of cults; and (<i>b</i>) a provocation to the moral sense and
to self-interest through a burdensome pressure of rites or priestly
exactions. An exceptional personality, of course, may count for much in
the making of a movement; though the accident of the possession of
kingly power by a reformer seems to count for much more than does
genius.</p>
<p>2. The fortunes of such reactions are determined by socio-economic
or political conditions. They are seen to be at a minimum, as to energy
and social effect, in the conditions of greatest social invariability,
as in ancient Egypt, where progress in thought, slow at best, was
confined to the priestly and official class, and never affected popular
culture.</p>
<p>3. In the absence of social conditions fitted to raise popular
levels of life and thought, every religious system tends to worsen
intellectually in the sense of adding to its range of
superstition&mdash;that is, of ignorant and unreasoning belief.
Credulity has its own momentum. Even the possession of limitary sacred
books cannot check this tendency&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Hinduism, Judaism,
Mohammedanism, Mazdeism, Christianity up till the age of doubt and
science, and the systems of ancient Egypt, Babylon, and post-Confucian
China. This worsening can take place alongside of a theoretic
purification of belief within the sphere of the educated theological
class.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Christian writers have undertaken to show that such
deterioration went on continuously in India from the beginning of the
Vedic period, popular religion sinking from Varuna to Indra, from Indra
to the deities of the Atharva Veda, and from these to the Puranas (cp.
Dr. J. Murray Mitchell, <i>Hinduism Past and Present</i>, 1885, pp. 22,
25, 26, 54). The argument, being hostile in bias from the beginning,
ignores or denies the element of intellectual advance in the Upanishads
and other later literature; but it holds good of the general phenomena.
It holds good equally, however, of the history of Christianity in the
period of the supremacy of ignorant faith and absence of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>doubt
and science; and is relatively applicable to the religion of the
uneducated mass at any time and place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is not at all true that religious history is
from the beginning, in any case, a process of mere degeneration from a
pure ideal. Simple statements as to primitive ideas are found to be
misleading because of their simplicity. They <i>can</i> connote only
the ethic of the life conditions of the worshipper. Now, we have seen
(p. 28) that small primitive peoples living at peace and in communism,
or in some respects well placed, may be on that account in certain
moral respects superior to the average or mass of more civilized and
more intelligent peoples. [As to the kindliness and unselfishness of
some savages, living an almost communal life, and as to the scrupulous
honesty of others, there is plenty of evidence&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, as to
Andaman islanders, Max M&uuml;ller, <i>Anthrop. Relig.</i>, citing
Colonel Cadell, p. 177; as to Malays and Papuans, Dr. Russel Wallace,
<i>Malay Archipelago</i>, p. 595 (but cp. pp. 585, 587, 589); as to
Esquimaux, Keane, <i>Man</i>, p. 374; Reclus, <i>Primitive Folk</i>,
pp. 15, 37, 115 (but cp. pp. 41&ndash;42). In these and other cases
unselfishness within the tribe is the concomitant of the communal life,
and represents no conscious ethical volition, being concurrent with
phases of the grossest tribal egoism, in some cases with cannibalism,
and with the perpetual oppression of women. In the case of the
preaching of unselfishness to the young by the old among the
Australians, where Lubbock and his authorities see &ldquo;the tyranny
of the old&rdquo; (<i>Origin of Civilization</i>, 5th ed. pp.
451&ndash;52) Mr. Lang sees a pure primeval ethic. Obviously the other
is the true explanation. The closest and best qualified observers
testify, as regards a number of tribes: &ldquo;So far as anything like
moral precepts are concerned in these tribes &hellip; it appears to us
to be most probable that they have originated in the first instance in
association with the purely selfish ideas of the older men to keep all
the best things for themselves, and in no case whatever are they
supposed to have the sanction of a superior being&rdquo; (Spencer and
Gillen, <i>North. Tribes of Cent. Australia</i>, 1904, p. 504).]</p>
<p>The transition from that state to one of war and individualism would
be in a sense degeneration; but on the other hand the entirely
communistic societies are unprogressive. Broadly speaking, it is by the
path of social individuation that progress in civilization has been
made, the early city States and the later large military States
ultimately securing within themselves some of the conditions for
special development of thought, arts, and knowledge. The residual truth
is that the simple religion of the harmless tribe is <i lang="la">pro
tanto</i> superior to the instituted religion of the more civilized
nation with greater heights and lower depths of life, the popular
religion in the latter case standing for the worse conditions. But the
simple religion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>did not spring from any higher stage of knowledge.
The old theorem revived by Mr. Lang (<i>Making of Religion</i>), as to
religion having originally been a pure and highly ethical monotheism,
from which it degenerated into animism and non-moral polytheism, is at
best a misreading of the facts just stated. Mr. Lang never asks what
&ldquo;Supreme Being&rdquo; and &ldquo;monotheism&rdquo; mean for
savages who know nothing of other men&rsquo;s religions: he virtually
takes all the connotations for granted. And as regards the most closely
studied of contemporary savages our authorities come to an emphatic
conclusion that they have no notion whatever of anything like a Supreme
Being (Spencer and Gillen, <i>North. Tribes of Cent. Austr.</i> pp.
491&ndash;92. Cp. A. H. Keane, <i>Man</i>, p. 395, as to the
&ldquo;Great Spirit&rdquo; of the Redskins). For the rest, Mr.
Lang&rsquo;s theory is demonstrably wrong in its ethical interpretation
of many anthropological facts, and as it stands is quite irreconcilable
with the law of evolution, since it assumes an abstract monotheism as
primordial. In general it approximates scientifically to the
eighteenth-century doctrine of the superiority of savagery to
civilization. (See it criticized in the author&rsquo;s <i>Studies in
Religious Fallacy</i>, and <i>Christianity and Mythology</i>, 2nd ed.
pp. 37&ndash;43, 46 <i>sq.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. Even primary conditions of material well-being, if not reacted
upon by social science or a movement of freethought, may in a
comparatively advanced civilization promote religious degeneration.
Thus abundance of food is favourable to multiplication of sacrifice,
and so to priestly predominance.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5915src"
href="#xd25e5915" name="xd25e5915src">215</a> The possession of
domesticated animals, so important to civilization, lends itself to
sacrifice in a specially demoralizing degree. But abundant cereal
food-supply, making abundant population, may greatly promote human
sacrifice&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Mexico.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The error of Mr. Lang&rsquo;s method is seen in the
use he makes (work cited, pp. 286&ndash;289, 292) of the fact that
certain &ldquo;low&rdquo; races&mdash;as the Australians, Andamanese,
Bushmen, and Fuegians&mdash;offer no animal sacrifice. He misses the
obvious significance of the facts that these unwarlike races have as a
rule no domesticated animals and no agriculture, and that their food
supply is thus in general precarious. The Andamanese, sometimes
described (Malthus, <i>Essay on Population</i>, ch. iii, and refs.; G.
W. Earl, <i>Papuans</i>, 1853, pp. 150&ndash;51) as very ill-fed, are
sometimes said to be well supplied with fish and game (Peschel,
<i>Races of Man</i>, Eng. tr. 1876, p. 147; Max M&uuml;ller,
<i>Anthrop. Rel.</i> citing Cadell, p. 177); but in any case they have
had no agriculture, and seem to have only occasional animal food in the
shape of a wild hog (Colebrooke in <i>Asiatic Researches</i>, iv, 390).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>The Australians and Fuegians, again, have often
great difficulty in feeding themselves (Peschel, pp. 148, 159, 334;
Darwin, <i>Voyage</i>, ch. 10). It is argued concerning the Australian
aborigines that &ldquo;as a rule they have an abundance&rdquo; (A. F.
Calvert, <i>The Aborigines of Western Australia</i>, 1894, p. 24); but
this abundance is made out by cataloguing the whole edible fauna and
flora of the coasts and the interior, and ignores the fact that for all
hunting peoples food supply is precarious. For the Australian,
&ldquo;the difficulty of capturing game with his primitive methods
compels him to give his whole time to the quest of food&rdquo; (Keane,
<i>Man</i>, p. 148). In the contrary case of the primitive Vedic
Aryans, well supplied with animals, sacrifices were abundant, and
tended to become more so (M&uuml;ller, <i>Nat. Relig.</i> pp. 136, 185;
<i>Physical Relig.</i> p. 105; but cp. pp. 98, 101; Mitchell,
<i>Hinduism</i>, p. 43; Lefmann, <i lang="de">Geschichte des alten
Indiens</i>, in Oncken&rsquo;s series, 1890, pp. 49, 430&ndash;31). Of
these sacrifices that of the horse seems to have been in Aryan use in a
most remote period (cp. M. M&uuml;ller, <i>Nat. Rel.</i> pp.
524&ndash;25; H. B&ouml;ttger, <i lang="de">Sonnencult der
Indogermanen</i>, Breslau, 1891, pp. 41&ndash;44; Preller, <i lang=
"de">R&ouml;mische Mythologie</i>, ed. K&ouml;hler, pp. 102, 299, 323;
<i lang="de">Griechische Mythologie</i>, 2te Aufg. i, 462; Frazer,
<i>Golden Bough</i>, ii, 315). Max M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s remark
(<i>Physical Religion</i>, p. 106), that &ldquo;the idea of sacrifice
did not exist at a <i>very</i> early period,&rdquo; because there is no
common Aryan term for it, counts for nothing, as he admits (p. 107)
that the Sanskrit word cannot be traced back to any more general root;
and he concedes the antiquity of the <i>practice</i>. On this cp.
Mitchell, <i>Hinduism</i>, pp. 37&ndash;38; and the author&rsquo;s
<i>Pagan Christs</i>, 2nd ed. p. 122. The reform in Hindu sacrifice,
consummated by Buddhism, has been noted above.</p>

<p>5. Even scientific knowledge, while enabling the thoughtful to
correct their religious conceptions, in some forms lends itself easily
to the promotion of popular superstition. Thus the astronomy of the
Babylonians, while developing some skepticism, served in general to
encourage divination and fortune-telling; and seems to have had the
same effect when communicated to the Chinese, the Hindus, and the
Hebrews, all of whom, however, practised divination previously on other
bases.</p>
<p>6. Finally, the development of the arts of sculpture and painting,
unaccompanied by due intellectual culture, tends to keep religion at a
low anthropomorphic level, and worsens its psychology by inviting
image-worship.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6003src" href="#xd25e6003"
name="xd25e6003src">216</a> It is not that the earlier and non-artistic
religions are not anthropomorphic, but that they give more play for
intellectual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>imagination than does a cult of images. But where
the arts have been developed, idolatry has always arisen save when
resisted by a special activity or revival of freethought to that end;
and even in Protestant Christendom, where image-worship is tabooed,
religious pictures now promote popular credulity and ritualism as they
did in the Italian Renaissance.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6011src"
href="#xd25e6011" name="xd25e6011src">217</a> So manifold are the

an attained ideal or stage of development, not from any primordial
knowledge. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=

has advanced the view that the adherents of this doctrine, who

beginners of Buddhism. But the view that the universe is a
self-existent totality appears to enter into the Brahmans&rsquo;

the esoteric Ved&acirc;nta (Ballantyne, <i>Christianity Contrasted with

Virginia and Lucretia are primarily ancient Latin divinities; and (ch.
vii) that both Numa and Servius Tullius are probably in the same case,
Servius Rex being in all likelihood the <i lang="la">servus rex

Dr. J. G. Frazer&rsquo;s <i>Golden Bough</i>; while <i>tullius</i> is
an old Latin word for a spring. See also ch. iv as to Acca Larentia,
another Goddess reduced by the historians to the status of a

to deity, as in the phrase &ldquo;the Great Architect&rdquo;
(Chalmers&rsquo; trans. 1868. ch. lxxiv, p. 57), and
&ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; is spoken of in a somewhat personalized sense.
Still, Mr. Chalmers complains (p. xv) that Lao-Tsze did not recognize a

them, however, with being the first makers of roads and aqueducts in

R&eacute;ville speaks of the worship of the unifying deity as pretty
much &ldquo;effaced&rdquo; by that of the lower Gods. It seems rather
to have been a priestly effort to syncretize these. Still, such an
effacement did take place, as we have seen, in Central Asia in ancient
times, after a syncretic idea had been reached (above, p. 45). As to

<p class="first">The modern critical analysis of the Hebrew Sacred

and sole deity out of normal primitive polytheism.<a class="noteref"

special to the Hebrews was the set of social conditions under which the
evolution took place. Through these conditions it was that the relative
freethought which rejected normal polytheism was so far favoured as to
lead to a pronounced monotheistic cultus, though not to a philosophic
monotheism.</p>

<p class="first">As seen in their earliest historical documents
(especially portions of the Book of Judges), the Hebrews are a group of
agricultural and pastoral but warlike tribes of Semitic speech, with
household Gods and local deities,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6035src"
href="#xd25e6035" name="xd25e6035src">2</a> living among communities at
the same or a higher culture stage. Their ancestral legends show
similar religious practice.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6038src" href=
"#xd25e6038" name="xd25e6038src">3</a> Of the Hebrew tribes some may

construction.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6046src" href="#xd25e6046"
name="xd25e6046src">4</a> At one time twelve such tribes may have
confederated, in conformity with a common ancient superstition, seen in
Arab and Greek history as well as in the Jewish, as to the number
twelve. As they advanced in civilization, on a basis of city life
existing among a population settled in Canaan before them, parts of
which they conquered, one of their public cults, that of Yahu or
Yahweh, finally fixed at Jerusalem, became politically important. The
special worshippers of this God (supposed to have been at first a
Thunder-God or Nature-God)<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6052src" href=
"#xd25e6052" name="xd25e6052src">5</a> were in that sense monotheists;
but not otherwise than kindred neighbouring communities such as the
Ammonites and Moabites and Edomites, each of which had its special God,
like the cities of Babylonia and Egypt. But that the earlier
conceptions of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=

clear from the fact that even in the later literary efforts to impose
the sole cult of Yahweh on the people, the plural name <i>Elohim</i>,
&ldquo;Powers&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gods&rdquo; (in general, things to be
feared),<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6076src" href="#xd25e6076" name=

prefixed, though cosmology had previously been written in

<p class="first">As to the original similarity of Hebraic and other
Canaanite religions cp. E. Meyer, <i lang="de">Gesch. des Alt.</i>
&sect;&sect; 309&ndash;11 (i, 372&ndash;76); Kuenen, i, 223;
Wellhausen, <i>Israel</i>, p. 440; Winckler, <i lang="de">Gesch.
Israels</i>, <i>passim</i>; R&eacute;ville, <i lang="fr">Prol&eacute;g.
de l&rsquo;hist. des relig.</i> 1881, p. 85. &ldquo;Before being
monotheistic, Israel was simply <i>monolatrous</i>, and even that only
in its religious <i lang="fr">&eacute;lite</i>&rdquo; (R&eacute;ville).
&ldquo;Their [the Canaanites&rsquo;] worship was the same in principle
as that of Israel, but it had a higher organization&rdquo; (Menzies,
<i>Hist. of Rel.</i> p. 179; cp. Tiele, <i>Outlines</i>, pp.
85&ndash;89). On the side of the traditional view, Mr. Lang, while
sharply challenging most of the propositions of the higher critics,
affirms that &ldquo;<i>we know</i> that Israel had, in an early age,
the conception of the moral Eternal; we know that, at an early age, the
conception was contaminated and anthropomorphized; and we know that it
was rescued, in a great degree, from this corruption, while always
retaining its original ethical aspect and sanction&rdquo; (<i>Making of
Religion</i>, p. 295). If &ldquo;we know&rdquo; this, the discussion is
at an end. But Mr. Lang&rsquo;s sole documentary basis for the
assertion is just the fabricated record, reluctantly abandoned by
theological scholars as such. When this is challenged, Mr. Lang falls
back on the position that such low races as the Australians and
Fuegians have a &ldquo;moral Supreme Being,&rdquo; and that therefore
Israel &ldquo;must&rdquo; have had one (p. 309). It will be found,
however, that the ethic of these races is perfectly primitive, on Mr.
Lang&rsquo;s own showing, and that his estimate is a misinterpretation.
As to their Supreme Beings, it might suffice to compare Mr.
Lang&rsquo;s <i>Making of Religion</i>, chs. ix, xii, with his earlier
<i>Myth, Ritual, and Religion</i>, i, 168, 335; ii, 6, etc.; but, as we
have seen (above, p. 93), the Supreme Being of the Australians eludes
the closest search in a number of tribes; and the &ldquo;moral&rdquo;
factor is equally intangible. Mr. Lang in his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>later
reasoning has merely added the ambiguous and misleading epithet
&ldquo;Supreme,&rdquo; stressing it indefinitely, to the ordinary
God-idea of the lower races. (Cp. Cox, <i>Mythol. of Aryan Races</i>,
ed. 1882, p. 155; and K. O. M&uuml;ller, <i>Introd. to Sci. Mythol.</i>
Eng. tr. p. 184.)</p>
<p>There being thus no highly imagined &ldquo;moral Eternal&rdquo; in
the religion of primitive man, the Hebrews were originally in the
ordinary position. Their early practice of human sacrifice is implied
in the legend of Abraham and Isaac, and in the story of Jephthah. (Cp.

1 Sam. vii, 3</a>.) These things Mr. Lang seems to admit (p. 309,
<i>note</i>), despite his previous claim; but he builds (p. 332) on the
fact that the Hebrews showed little concern about a future
state&mdash;that &ldquo;early Israel, having, so far as we know, a
singular lack of interest in the future of the soul, was born to give
himself up to developing, undisturbed, the theistic conception, the
belief in a righteous Eternal&rdquo;&mdash;whereas later Greeks and
Romans, like Egyptians, were much concerned about life after death. Mr.
Lang&rsquo;s own general theory would really require that <i>all</i>
peoples at a certain stage should act like the Israelites; but he
suspends it in the interest of the orthodox view as to the early
Hebrews. At the same time he omits to explain why the Hebrews failed to
adopt the future-state creed when they were
&ldquo;contaminated&rdquo;&mdash;a proposition hardly reconcilable, on
any view, with the sentence just quoted. The solution, however, is
simple. Israel was not at all &ldquo;singular&rdquo; in the matter. The
<i>early</i> (Homeric) Greeks and Romans (cp. as to Hades the
<i>Iliad</i>, <i>passim</i>; <i>Odyssey</i>, bk. xi, <i>passim</i>;
Tiele, <i>Outlines</i>, p. 209, as to the myth of Persephone; and
Preller, <i lang="de">R&ouml;mische Mythologie</i>, ed. K&ouml;hler,
1865, pp. 452&ndash;55, as to the early Romans), like the early Vedic
Aryans (Tiele, <i>Outlines</i>, p. 117; M&uuml;ller, <i>Anthropol.
Relig.</i> p. 269), and the early Babylonians and Assyrians (Meyer,
<i lang="de">Gesch. des Alt.</i> i, 181&ndash;82; Sayce, Hib. Lect. p.
364) took little thought of a future state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homer knows <i>no</i> influence of the Psyche on the realm of
the visible, and also no cult implying it&#8202;&hellip;. A later poet,
who made the last addition to the <i>Odyssey</i>, first introduced
Hermes the &lsquo;leader of souls&rsquo; [perhaps taken from a popular
belief in some part of Hellas]&hellip;. Underneath, in the gloomy
shades, the souls waver, unconscious or at the best in a glimmering
half-consciousness, endowed with faint voices, feeble,
indifferent&#8202;&hellip;. To speak, as do many old and recent
scholars, of the &lsquo;immortal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100"
href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>life&rsquo; of such souls, is
erroneous. They live rather as the spectre of the living in a
mirror&#8202;&hellip;. If the Psyche outlives her visible mate (the
body), she is powerless without him&#8202;&hellip;. Thus is the Homeric
world free from ghosts (for after the burning of the body the Psyche
appears no more even in dream)&hellip;. The living has peace from the
dead&#8202;&hellip;. No d&aelig;monic power is at work apart from or
against the Gods; and the night gives to the disembodied spirits no
freedom&rdquo; (Rohde, <i>Psyche</i>, 4te Aufl. 1907, pp.
9&ndash;11).</p>
<p>This minimization of the normal primitive belief in spirits is one
of the reasons for seeing in the Homeric poems the outcome of a period
of loosened belief. It is not to be supposed that the pre-Homeric
Greeks, like the easterns with whom the Greeks met in Ionia, had not
the usual ghost-lore of savages and barbarians; and it may be that for
all the early civilizations under notice the explanation is that
primitive ghost-cults were abandoned by migrating and conquering races,
who rejected the ghost-cults of the races whom they conquered, though
they ostensibly accepted their Gods. In any case they made little
religious account of a future state for themselves.</p>
<p>This attitude has again been erroneously regarded (<i>e.g.</i>,
Dickinson, <i>The Greek View of Life</i>, p. 35) as peculiar to the
Greeks. Mr. Lang&rsquo;s assumption may, in fact, be overthrown by the
single case of the Phoenicians, who showed no more concern about a
future life than did the Hebrews (see Canon Rawlinson&rsquo;s
<i>History of Phoenicia</i>, 1889, pp. 351&ndash;52), but who are not
pretended to have given themselves up much to &ldquo;developing,
undisturbed, the belief in a righteous Eternal.&rdquo; The truth seems
to be that in all the early progressive and combative civilizations the
main concern was as to the continuance of <i>this</i> life. On that
head the Hebrews were as solicitous as any (cp. Kuenen, i, 65); and
they habitually practised divination on that score. Further, they
attached the very highest importance to the continuance of the
individual in his offspring. The idea of a future state is first found
highly developed in the long-lived cults of the long-civilized but
unprogressive Egyptians; and the Babylonians were developing in the
same direction. Yet the Hebrews took it up (see the evidence in
Sch&uuml;rer, <i>Jewish People in the Time of Jesus</i>, Eng. tr. Div.
II, vol. ii, p. 179) just when, according to Mr. Lang, their cult was
&ldquo;rescued, in a great degree, from corruption&rdquo;; and,
generally speaking, it was in the stage of maximum monotheism that they
reached the maximum of irrationality. For the rest, belief in
&ldquo;immortality&rdquo; is found highly developed in a sociologically
&ldquo;degenerate&rdquo; and unprogressive people such as the
Tasmanians (M&uuml;ller, <i>Anthrop. Rel.</i> p. 433), who are yet
primitively pure on Mr. Lang&rsquo;s hypothesis; and is normal among
negroes and Australian blackfellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=

<p>This primary polytheism is seen to the full in that constant resort
of Israelites to neighbouring cults, against which so much of the
Hebrew doctrine is directed. To understand their practice the modern
reader has to get rid of the hallucination imposed on Christendom by
its idea of revelation. The cult of Yahweh was no primordial Hebrew
creed, deserted by backsliding idolaters, but a finally successful
tyranny of one local cult over others. It is probable that it was
originally not Palestinian, but Sinaitic, and that Yahweh became the
God of Caleb-Judah only under David.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e6277src" href="#xd25e6277" name="xd25e6277src">8</a> Therefore,
without begging the question as to the moral sincerity of the prophets
and others who identified Yahwism with morality, we must always
remember that they were on their own showing devotees of a special
local worship, and so far fighting for their own influence. Similar
prophesying may conceivably have been carried on in connection with the
same or other God-names in other localities, and the extant prophets
freely testify that they had Yahwistic opponents; but the circumstance
that Yahweh was worshipped at Jerusalem without any image might be an
important cause of differentiation in the case of that cult. In any
case it must have been through simple &ldquo;exclusivism&rdquo; that
they reached any form of &ldquo;monotheism.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e6283src" href="#xd25e6283" name="xd25e6283src">9</a></p>
<p>The inveterate usage, in the Bible-making period, of forging and
interpolating ancient or pretended writings, makes it impossible to
construct any detailed history of the rise of Yahwism. We can but
proceed upon data which do not appear to lend themselves to the
purposes of the later adaptors. In that way we see cause to believe
that at one early centre the so-called ark of Yahweh contained various
objects held to have supernatural virtue.<a class="noteref" id=

3). But Saul and Solomon also were God-names (Sayce, as cited), as was
Samuel (<i>id.</i> pp. 54, 181; cp. Lenormant, <i>Chaldean Magic</i>,
Eng. tr. p. 120); and when we note these data, and further the plain
fact that Samson is a solar myth, being a personage Evemerized from
Samas, the Sun-God, we are prepared to find further traces of
Evemeristic redaction in the Hebrew books. To say nothing of other
figures in the Book of Judges, we find that Jacob and Joseph were old
Canaanitish deities (Sayce, Lectures, p. 51; Records of the Past, New
Series, v, 48; Hugo Winckler, <i lang="de">Geschichte Israels</i>, ii,
57&ndash;77); and that Moses, as might be expected, was a name for more
than one Semitic God (Sayce, pp. 46&ndash;47), and in particular stood
for a Sun-God. Abraham and Isaac in turn appear to be ancient deities
(Meyer, <i lang="de">Gesch. des Alt.</i> i, 374, &sect; 309; Winckler,
<i lang="de">Gesch. Israels</i>, ii, 20&ndash;49). Miriam was probably
in similar case (cp. <i>Pagan Christs</i>, 2nd ed. pp. 165&ndash;66).
On an analysis of the Joshua myth as redacted, further, we may surmise
another reduction of an ancient cult to the form of history, perhaps
obscuring the true original of the worship of Mary and Jesus.</p>
<p>It seems probable, finally, that such figures as Elijah, who ascends
to heaven in a fiery chariot, and Elisha, the &ldquo;bald head&rdquo;
and miracle-worker, are similar constructions of personages out of
Sun-God lore. In such material lies part of the refutation of the
thesis of Renan (<i lang="fr">Hist, des langues s&eacute;mit.</i> 2e
&eacute;dit. pp. 7, 485) that the Semites were natural monotheists,
devoid of mythology. [Renan is followed in whole or in part by

connected with the assumption that life in a &ldquo;desert&rdquo; makes
a race for ever unimaginative or unitary in its thought. The <i>Arabian
Nights</i> might be supposed a sufficient proof to the contrary. The
historic truth seems to be that, stage for stage, the ancient Semites
were as mythological as any other race; but that (to say nothing of the
Babylonians and Assyrians) the mythologies of the Hebrews and of the
Arabs were alike suppressed as far as possible in their monotheistic
stage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=

<p>At other places, however, Yahweh was symbolized and worshipped in
the image of a young bull,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6424src" href=
"#xd25e6424" name="xd25e6424src">14</a> a usage associated with the
neighbouring Semitic cult of Molech, but probably indigenous, or at
least early, in the case of Yahweh also. A God, for such worshippers,
needed to be represented by something, if he were to be individualized
as against others; and where there was not an ark or a sacred stone or
special temple or idol there could be no cult at all. &ldquo;The
practices of ancient religion require a fixed meeting-place between the
worshippers and their God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6438src"
href="#xd25e6438" name="xd25e6438src">15</a> The pre-Exilic history of
Yahweh-worship seems to be in large part that of a struggle between the
devotees of the imageless worship fixed to the temple at Jerusalem, and
other worships, with or without images, at other and less influential
shrines.</p>
<p>So far as can be gathered from the documents, it was long before
monotheistic pretensions were made in connection with Yahwism. They
must in the first instance have seemed not only tyrannical but
blasphemous to the devotees of the old local shrines, who in the
earlier Hebrew writings figure as perfectly good Yahwists; and they
clearly had no durable success before the period of the Exile. Some
three hundred years after the supposed period of David,<a class=

ostensible traces<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6451src" href="#xd25e6451"
name="xd25e6451src">17</a> of a movement for the special aggrandizement
of the Yahweh cult and the suppression of the others which competed
with it, as well as of certain licentious and vicious practices carried
on in connection with Yahweh worship. Concerning these, it could be
claimed by those who had adhered to the simpler tradition of one of the
early worships that they were foreign importations. They were, in fact,
specialties of a rich ancient society, and were either native to
Canaanite cities which the Hebrews had captured, or copied by them from
such cities. But the fact that they were thus, on the showing of the
later Yahwistic records, long associated with Yahwist practice, proves
that there was no special elevation about Yahwism originally.</p>

somewhat misleading to cite Wellhausen (so Lang, <i>Making of
Religion</i>, p. 304) as saying (<i>Israel</i>, p. 437) that religion
inspired law and morals in Israel with exceptional purity. In the
context Wellhausen has said that the starting-point of Israel was
normal; and he writes in the <i>Prolegomena</i> (p. 302) that
&ldquo;good and evil in Hebrew mean primarily nothing more than
salutary and hurtful: the application of the words to virtue and sin is
a secondary one, these being regarded as serviceable or hurtful in

<p class="first">Given the co-existence of a multitude of local cults,
and of various local Yahweh-worships, it is conceivable that the
Yahwists of Jerusalem, backed by a priest-ridden king, should seek to
limit all worship to their own temple, whose revenues would thereby be
much increased. But insoluble perplexities are set up as to the alleged
movement by the incongruities in the documents. Passing over for the
moment the prophets Amos and Hosea and others who ostensibly belong to
the eighth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, we find the second
priestly reform,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6520src" href="#xd25e6520"
name="xd25e6520src">18</a> consequent on a finding or framing of
&ldquo;the law,&rdquo; represented as occurring early in the reign of
Josiah (641&ndash;610 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>). But later in the
same reign are placed the writings of Jeremiah, who constantly contemns
the scribes, prophets, and priests in mass, and makes light of the
ark,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6528src" href="#xd25e6528" name=
"xd25e6528src">19</a> besides declaring that in Judah<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e6555src" href="#xd25e6555" name="xd25e6555src">20</a> there
are as many Gods as towns, and in Jerusalem as many Baal-altars as
streets. The difficulty is reduced by recognizing the quasi-historical
narrative as a later fabrication; but other difficulties remain as to
the prophetic writings; and for our present purpose it is necessary
briefly to consider these.</p>
<p>1. The &ldquo;higher criticism,&rdquo; seeking solid standing-ground
at the beginning of the tangible historic period, the eighth century,
singles out<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6565src" href="#xd25e6565" name=
"xd25e6565src">21</a> the books of Amos and Hosea, setting aside, as
dubious in date, Nahum and Joel; and recognizing in Isaiah a composite
of different periods. If Amos, the &ldquo;herdsman of Tekoa,&rdquo;
could be thus regarded as an indubitable historical person, he would be
a remarkable figure in the history of freethought, as would his nominal
contemporary Hosea. Amos is a monotheist, worshipping not a God of
Israel but a Yahweh or Elohim of Hosts, called also by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>name
Adon or Adonai, &ldquo;the Lord,&rdquo; who rules all the nations and
created the universe. Further, the prophet makes Yahweh &ldquo;hate and
despise&rdquo; the feasts and burnt-offerings and solemn assemblies of
his worshippers;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6570src" href="#xd25e6570"
name="xd25e6570src">22</a> and he meddles impartially with the affairs
of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel. In the same spirit Hosea menaces
the solemn assemblies, and makes Yahweh desire &ldquo;mercy and not
sacrifice.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6575src" href="#xd25e6575"
name="xd25e6575src">23</a> Similar doctrine occurs in the reputedly
genuine or ancient parts of Isaiah,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6583src"
href="#xd25e6583" name="xd25e6583src">24</a> and in Micah.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e6589src" href="#xd25e6589" name=
"xd25e6589src">25</a> Isaiah, too, disparages the Sabbath and solemn
meetings, staking all upon righteousness.</p>
<p>2. These utterances, so subversive of the priestly system, are yet
held to have been preserved through the ages&mdash;through the Assyrian
conquest, through the Babylonian Captivity, through the later period of
priestly reconstruction&mdash;by the priestly system itself. In the
state of things pictured under Ezra and Nehemiah, only the zealous
adherents of the priestly law can at the outset have had any letters,
any literature; it must have been they, then, who treasured the
anti-priestly and anti-ritual writings of the prophets&mdash;unless,
indeed, the latter were preserved by the Jews remaining at Babylon.</p>
<p>3. The perplexity thus set up is greatly deepened when we remember
that the period assigned to the earlier prophets is near the beginning
of the known age of alphabetic writing,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e6598src" href="#xd25e6598" name="xd25e6598src">26</a> and before
the known age of writing on scrolls. A herdsman of Judea, with a
classic and flowing style, is held to have written out his hortatory
addresses at a time when such writing is not certainly known to have
been practised anywhere else;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6626src" href=
"#xd25e6626" name="xd25e6626src">27</a> and the pre-eminent style of
Isaiah is held to belong to the same period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;His [Amos&rsquo;s] language, with three or four
insignificant exceptions, is pure, his style classical and refined. His
literary power is shown in the regularity of structure which often
characterizes his periods &hellip; as well as in the ease with which he
evidently writes&#8202;&hellip;. Anything of the nature of roughness or
rusticity is wholly absent from his writings&rdquo; (Driver, <i>Introd.
to Lit. of Old Test.</i> ch. vi, &sect; 3, p. 297, ed. 1891). Isaiah,
again, is in his own narrow field one of the most gifted and skilful
writers of all antiquity. The difficulty is thus nearly as great
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>as that of the proposition that the Hebrew of
the Pentateuch is a thousand years older than that of the latest
prophetical books, whose language is substantially the same. (Cp.
Andrews Norton, <i>The Pentateuch</i>, ed. 1863, pp. 47&ndash;48;
Renan, <i lang="fr">Hist. des langues s&eacute;mit.</i> 2e &eacute;dit.
p. 118.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. The specialist critics, all trained as clergymen, and mostly loth
to yield more than is absolutely necessary to skepticism, have
surrendered the antiquity claimed for Joel, recognizing that the
arguments for that are &ldquo;equally consistent with a date
<i>after</i> the Captivity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6655src"
href="#xd25e6655" name="xd25e6655src">28</a> One of the conclusions
here involved is that &ldquo;Egypt is probably mentioned only as the
<i>typical instance</i> of a Power hostile to Judah.&rdquo; Thus, when
we remember the later Jewish practice of speaking of Rome as
&ldquo;Babylon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Edom,&rdquo; allusions by Amos and
Hosea to &ldquo;Assyria&rdquo; have no evidential force. The same
reasoning applies to the supposed ancient portions of Isaiah.</p>
<p>5. Even on the clerical side, among the less conservative critics,
it is already conceded that there are late &ldquo;insertions&rdquo; in
Amos. Some of these insertions are among, or analogous to, the very
passages relied on by Kuenen to prove the lofty monotheism of Amos. If
these passages, however, suggest a late date, no less do the others
disparaging sacrifices. The same critics find interpolations and
additions in Hosea. But they offer no proof of the antiquity of what
they retain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The principal passages in Amos given up as insertions
by Dr. Cheyne, the most perspicacious of the English Hebraists, are:

Smith&rsquo;s <i>Prophets of Israel</i>, p. xv; and his art. on Amos in

Cheyne regards as insertions in Hosea the following: <a class=

xiv, 1&ndash;9</a> (as cited, pp. xviii&ndash;xix). Obviously these
admissions entail others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. The same school of criticism, while adhering to the traditional
dating of Amos and Hosea, has surrendered the claim for the Psalms,
placing most of these in the same age with the books of Job, Proverbs,
Ecclesiastes, and Ecclesiasticus.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6714src"
href="#xd25e6714" name="xd25e6714src">29</a> Now, the sentiment of
opposition to burnt-offerings is found in some of the Psalms in
language identical with that of the supposed early prophets.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e6726src" href="#xd25e6726" name=
"xd25e6726src">30</a> Instead of taking the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>former for late echoes of the latter, we may
reasonably suspect that they belong to the same culture-stage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The principle is in effect recognized by Dr. Cheyne
when he writes: &ldquo;Just as we infer from the reference to Cyrus in
xliv, 28; xlv, 1, that the prophecy containing it proceeds from the age
of the conqueror, so we may infer from the fraternal feeling towards
Egypt and Assyria (Syria) in xix, 23&ndash;25, that the epilogue was
written when hopes of the union and fusion of Israelitish and
non-Israelitish elements first became natural for the
Jews&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, in the early Jewish period&rdquo; (<i>Introd.
to the Book of Isaiah</i>, 1895, pp. 109&ndash;10).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7. From the scientific point of view, finally, the element of
historical prediction in the prophets is one of the strongest grounds
for presuming that they are in reality late documents. In regard to
similar predictions in the gospels (<a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2024:15&amp;version=NRSV">Mt.

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2021:20&amp;version=NRSV">
Lk. xxi, 20</a>), rational criticism decides that they were written
after the event. No other course can consistently be taken as to early
Hebrew predictions of captivity and restoration; and the adherence of
many Biblical scholars at this point to the traditional view is
psychologically on a par with their former refusal to accept a rational
estimate of the Pentateuchal narrative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">On some points, such as the flagrant pseudo-prediction
in <a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2019:18&amp;version=NRSV">
Isaiah xix, 18</a>, all reasonable critics surrender. Thus
&ldquo;K&ouml;nig sees rightly that xix, 18, can refer only to Jewish
colonies in Egypt, and <i>refrains from the arbitrary supposition that
Isaiah was supernaturally informed</i> of the future establishment of
such colonies&rdquo; (Cheyne, Introd. to Smith&rsquo;s <i>Prophets of
Israel</i>, p. xxxiii). But in other cases Dr. Cheyne&rsquo;s own
earlier positions appear to involve such an &ldquo;arbitrary
supposition,&rdquo; as do Kuenen&rsquo;s; and Smith explicitly posited
it as to the prophets in general. And even as to <a class=
"biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2019:18&amp;version=NRSV">
Isaiah xix, 18</a>, whereas Hitzig, as Havet later, rightly brings the
date down to the actual historic time of the establishment of the
temple at Heliopolis by Onias (Josephus, <i>Ant.</i> xiii, 3, 1;
<i>Wars</i>, vii, 10, 2), about 160 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, Dr.
Cheyne (<i>Introd. to Isaiah</i>, p. 108) compromises by dating it
about 275 <span class="sc">B.C.</span></p>
<p>The lateness of the bulk of the prophetical writings has been ably
argued by Ernest Havet (<i lang="fr">Le Christianisme et ses
Origines</i>, vol. iv, 1878, ch. vi; and in the posthumous vol.,
<i lang="fr">La Modernit&eacute; des Proph&egrave;tes</i>, 1891), who
supports his case by many cogent reasonings. For instance, besides the
argument as to <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2019:18&amp;version=NRSV">
Isaiah xix, 18</a>, above noted: (1) The frequent prediction of the

proof of the fallibility of the prophets and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>candour of their transcribers), is to be
understood in the light of other post-predictions as referring to the
actual capture of the city by Alexander. (2) Hosea&rsquo;s prediction
of the fall of Judah as well as of Israel, and of their being united,
places the passage after the Exile, and may even be held to bring it
down to the period of the Asmoneans. So with many other details: the
whole argument deserves careful study. M. Havet&rsquo;s views were, of
course, scouted by the conservative specialists, as their predecessors
scouted the entire hypothesis of Graf, now taken in its essentials as
the basis of sound Biblical criticism. M. Scherer somewhat
unintelligently objected to him (<i lang="fr">&Eacute;tudes sur la
litt. contemp.</i> vii, 268) that he was not a Hebraist. There is no
question of philology involved. It was non-Hebraists who first pointed
out the practical incredibility of the central Pentateuchal narrative,
on the truth of which Kuenen himself long stood with other Hebraists.
(Cp. Wellhausen, <i>Proleg.</i> pp. 39, 347; also his (4th) ed. of
Bleek&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Einleit. in das alte Test.</i> 1878, p. 154;
and Kuenen, <i>Hexateuch</i>, Eng. tr. pp. xv, 43.) Colenso&rsquo;s
argument, in the gist of which he was long preceded by lay
freethinkers, was one of simple common sense. The weak side of M.
Havet&rsquo;s case is his undertaking to bring the prophets bodily down
to the Maccabean period. This is claiming too much. But his negative
argument is not affected by the reply (Darmesteter, <i lang="fr">Les
Proph&egrave;tes d&rsquo;Isra&euml;l</i>, 1895, pp. 128&ndash;31) to
his constructive theory.</p>
<p>[Since the above was written, two French critics, MM. Dujardin and
Maurice Vernes, have sought vigorously to reconstruct the history of
the prophetic books upon new lines. I have been unable to acquiesce in
their views at essential points, but would refer the reader to the
lucid and interesting survey of the problem in Mr. T. Whittaker&rsquo;s
<i>Priests, Philosophers, and Prophets</i> (Black, 1911), ch. vi.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that where hardly any documentary datum is intrinsically
sure, it is difficult to prove a negative for one more than for
another. The historical narratives being systematically tampered with
by one writer after another, and even presumptively late writings being
interpolated by still later scribes, we can never have demonstrative
proof as to the original date of any one prophet. Thus it is arguable
that fragments of utterance from eighth-century prophets may have
survived orally and been made the nucleus of later documents. This view
would be reconcilable with the fact that the prophets Isaiah, Hosea,
Amos, and Micah are all introduced with some modification of the
formula that they prophesied &ldquo;in the days of Uzziah, Jotham,
Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah,&rdquo; Jeroboam&rsquo;s name being
added in the cases of Hosea and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109"
href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>Amos. But that detail is also
reconcilable with absolute fabrication. To say nothing of sheer bad
faith in a community whose moral code said nothing against fraud save
in the form of judicial perjury, the Hebrew literature is profoundly
compromised by the simple fact that the religious development of the
people made the prestige of antiquity more essential there for the
purposes of propaganda than in almost any other society known to us.
Hence an all-pervading principle of literary dissimulation; and what
freethinking there was had in general to wear the guise of the very
force of unreasoning traditionalism to which it was inwardly most
opposed. Only thus could new thought find a hearing and secure its
preservation at the hands of the tribe of formalists. Even the
pessimist Koheleth, wearied with groping science, yet believing nothing
of the doctrine of immortality, must needs follow precedent and pose as
the fabulous King Solomon, son of the half-mythic David.</p>

<p class="first">We are forced, then, to regard with distrust all
passages in the &ldquo;early&rdquo; prophets which express either a
disregard of sacrifice and ritual, or a universalism incongruous with
all that we know of the native culture of their period. The strongest
ground for surmising a really &ldquo;high&rdquo; development of
monotheism in Judah before the Captivity is the stability of the life
there as compared with northern Israel.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e6851src" href="#xd25e6851" name="xd25e6851src">31</a> In this
respect the conditions might indeed be considered favourable to
priestly or other culture; but, on the other hand, the records
themselves exhibit a predominant polytheism. The presumption, then, is
strong that the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; passages in the prophets
concerning sacrifice belong to an age when such ideas had been reached
in more civilized nations, with whose thought travelled Jews could come
in contact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is true that some such ideas were current in Egypt
many centuries before the period under notice&mdash;a fact which alone
discounts the ethical originality claimed for the Hebrew prophets.
<i>E.g.</i>, the following passage from the papyrus of Ani, belonging
to the Nineteenth Dynasty, not later than 1288 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>: &ldquo;That which is detestable in the sanctuary of
God is noisy feasts; if thou implore him with a loving heart of which
all the words are mysterious, he will do thy matters, he hears thy
words, he accepts thine offerings&rdquo; (<i>Religion and Conscience in
Ancient Egypt</i>, by Flinders Petrie, 1898, p. 160). The word rendered
&ldquo;mysterious&rdquo; here may mean &ldquo;magical&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>or &ldquo;liturgical,&rdquo; or may merely
prescribe privacy or silence; and this last is the construction put
upon it by Renouf (Hibbert Lectures, 2nd ed. p. 102) and Erman
(<i>Handbook of Eg. Relig.</i> Eng. tr. p. 84). The same doctrine is
put in a hymn to Thoth (<i>id.</i>). But in any case we must look for
later culture-contacts as the source of the later Hebrew radicalism
under notice, though Egyptian sources are not to be wholly set aside.
See Kuenen, i, 395; and Brugsch, as there cited; but cp. Wellhausen,
<i>Israel</i>, p. 440.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that not only did they accept a cosmogony from the
Babylonians, but they were influenced by the lore of the Zoroastrian
Persians, with whom, as with the monotheists or pantheists of Babylon,
they would have grounds of sympathy. It is an open question whether
their special hostility to images does not date from the time of
Persian contact.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6887src" href="#xd25e6887"
name="xd25e6887src">32</a> Concerning the restoration, it has been
argued that only a few Jewish exiles returned to Jerusalem &ldquo;both
under Cyrus and under Dareios&rdquo;; and that, though the temple was
rebuilt under Dareios Hystaspis, the builders were not the <i>Gola</i>
or returned exiles, but that part of the Judahite population which had
not been deported to Babylon.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6899src" href=
"#xd25e6899" name="xd25e6899src">33</a> The problem is
obscure;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6905src" href="#xd25e6905" name=
"xd25e6905src">34</a> but, at least, the separatist spirit of the
redacted narratives of Ezra and Nehemiah (which in any case tell of an
opposite spirit) is not to be taken as a decisive clue to the character
of the new religion. For the rest, the many Jews who remained in
Babylon or spread elsewhere in the Persian Empire, and who developed
their creed on a non-local basis, were bound to be in some way affected
by the surrounding theology. And it is tolerably certain that not only
was the notion of angels derived by the Jews from either the
Babylonians or the Persians, but their rigid Sabbath and their weekly
synagogue meetings came from one or both of these sources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">That the Sabbath was an Akkado-Babylonian and Assyrian
institution is now well established (G. Smith, <i>Assyrian Eponym
Canon</i>, 1875, p. 20; Jastrow, <i>Relig. of Bab. and Assyria</i>, p.
377; Sayce, Hib. Lect. p. 76, and in Variorum Teacher&rsquo;s Bible,
ed. 1885, <i>Aids</i>, p. 71). It was before the fact was ascertained
that Kuenen wrote of the Sabbath (i, 245) as peculiar to Israel. The
Hebrews may have had it before the Exile; but it was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>clearly not then a great institution; and the
mention of Sabbaths in Amos (viii, 5) and Isaiah (i, 13) is one of the
reasons for doubting the antiquity of those books. The custom of
synagogue meetings on the Sabbath is post-exilic, and may have arisen
either in Babylon itself (so Wellhausen, <i>Israel</i>, p. 492) or in
imitation of Parsee practice (so Tiele, cited by Kuenen, iii, 35).
Compare E. Meyer, <i lang="de">Gesch. des Alt.</i> iii (1901), &sect;
131. The same alternative arises with regard to the belief in angels,
usually regarded as certainly Persian in origin (cp. Kuenen, iii, 37;
Tiele, <i>Outlines</i>, p. 90; and Sack, <i lang="de">Die
altj&uuml;dische Religion</i>, 1889, p. 133). This also could have been
Babylonian (Sayce, in Var. Bible, as cited, p. 71); even the demon
Asmodeus in the Book of Tobit, usually taken as Persian, being of
Babylonian derivation (<i>id.</i>). Cp. Darmesteter&rsquo;s introd. to
<i>Zendavesta</i>, 2nd ed. ch. v. On the other hand, the conception of
Satan, the Adversary, as seen in <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

Zech. iii, 1, 2</a>, seems to come from the Persian Ahriman, though the
Satan of Job has not Ahriman&rsquo;s status. Such a modification would
come of the wish to insist on the supremacy of the good God. And this
quasi-monotheistic view, again, we are led to regard, in the case of
the prophets, as a possible Babylonian derivation, or at least as a
result of the contact of Yahwists with Babylonian culture. To a foreign
influence, finally, must be definitely attributed the later Priestly
Code, over-ruling Deuteronomy, lowering the Levites, setting up a high
priest, calling the dues into the sanctuary, resting on the Torah the
cultus which before was rested on the patriarchs, and providing cities
and land for the Aaronidae and the Levites (Wellhausen,
<i>Prolegomena</i>, pp. 123, 127, 147, 149, 347; <i>Israel</i>, pp.
495, 497)&mdash;the latter an arrangement impossible in mountainous
Palestine, as regards the land-measurements (<i>id.</i> <i>Proleg.</i>
p. 159, following Gramberg and Graf), and clearly deriving from some
such country as Babylonia or Persia. As to the high-priest principle in
Babylon and Assyria, see Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, pp. 59&ndash;61;
Jastrow, as cited, p. 658.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the general effect of such contacts we have clear traces in two
of the most remarkable of the later books of the Old Testament, Job and
Ecclesiastes, both of which clearly belong to a late period in
religious development. The majority of the critics still confidently
describe Job as an original Hebrew work, mainly on the ground,
apparently, that it shows no clear marks of translation, though its
names and its local colour are all non-Jewish. In any case it
represents, for its time, a cosmopolitan culture, and contains the work
of more than one hand, the prologue and epilogue being probably older
than the rest; while much of the dialogue is obviously late
interpolation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=

dating of the book six or seven centuries before Ecclesiastes (<i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;Eccl&eacute;siaste</i>, p. 26; <i>Job</i>, pp.

Jeremiah and Ezekiel (Dillon, as cited); and Cornill even ascribes it
to the fourth or third century <span class="sc">B.C.</span> Dr. Cheyne
notes that in the skeptical passages the name Yahweh is very seldom
used (only once or twice, as in xii, 9; xxviii, 28); and Dr. Driver
admits that the whole book not only abounds in Aramaic words, but has a
good many &ldquo;explicable only from the Arabic.&rdquo; Other details
in the book suggest the possible culture-influence of the Himyarite
Arabs, who had reached a high civilization before 500 <span class=

thoroughly Hebraic&rdquo; burkes the entire problem as to the manifest
innovation the book makes in Hebrew thought and literary method alike.
Sharpe (p. 287) is equally arbitrary. Cp. Renan, <i>Job</i>, 1859, pp.
xxv, where the newness of the whole treatment is admitted.</p>
<p>Dr. Dillon (pp. 43&ndash;59), following Bickell, has pointed out
more or less convincingly the many interpolations made in the book
after, and even before, the making of the Septuagint translation, which
originally lacked 400 lines of the matter in the present Hebrew
version. The discovery of the Saidic version of the LXX text of Job
decides the main fact. (See Professor Bickell&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Das
Buch Job</i>, 1894.) &ldquo;It is quite possible even now to point out,
by the help of a few disjointed fragments still preserved, the
position, and to divine the sense, of certain spiteful and defiant
passages, which, in the interest of &lsquo;religion and morals,&rsquo;
were remorselessly suppressed; to indicate others which were split up
and transposed; and to distinguish many prolix discourses, feeble or
powerful word-pictures, and trite commonplaces, which were deliberately
inserted later on, for the sole purpose of toning down the most
audacious piece of rationalistic philosophy which has ever yet been
clothed in the music of sublime verse&rdquo; (Dillon, pp.
45&ndash;46).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the four hundred verses which must be excluded on the
ground that they are wanting in the Septuagint version, and were
therefore added to the text at a comparatively recent period, the
long-winded discourse of Elihu must be struck out, most [? much] of
which was composed before the book was first translated into
Greek&#8202;&hellip;. In the prologue in prose &hellip; Elihu is not
once alluded to; and in the epilogue, where all the [other] debaters
are named and censured, he &hellip; is absolutely
ignored&#8202;&hellip;. Elihu&rsquo;s style is <i lang="la">toto
c&oelig;lo</i> different from that of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>other parts of the
poem; &hellip; while his doctrinal peculiarities, particularly his
mention of interceding angels, while they coincide with those of the
New Testament, are absolutely unknown to Job and his
friends&#8202;&hellip;. The confusion introduced into the text by this
insertion is bewildering in the extreme; and yet the result is but a
typical specimen of the &hellip; tangle which was produced by the
systematic endeavour of later and pious editors to reduce the poem to
the proper level of orthodoxy&rdquo; (<i>id.</i> pp. 55&ndash;57).
Again: &ldquo;Ch. xxiv, 5&ndash;8, 10&ndash;24, and ch. xxx, 3&ndash;7,
take the place of Job&rsquo;s blasphemous complaint about the unjust
government of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It need hardly be added here that not only the Authorized but the
Revised Version is false in the text &ldquo;I know that my redeemer
liveth,&rdquo; etc. (<a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

</blockquote>
<p>What marks off the book of Job from all other Hebrew literature is
its dramatic and reflective handling of the ethical problem of theism,
which the prophets either evade or dismiss by declamation against
Jewish sins. Not that it is solved in Job, where the <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
of Satan is an inconclusive resort to the Persian dualistic solution,
and where the deity is finally made to answer Job&rsquo;s freethinking
by sheer literary thunder, much less ratiocinative though far more
artistic than the theistic speeches of the friends. But at least the
writer or writers of Job&rsquo;s speeches consciously grasped the
issue; and the writer of the epilogue evidently felt that the least
Yahweh could do was to compensate a man whom he had allowed to be
wantonly persecuted. The various efforts of ancient thought to solve
the same problem will be found to constitute the motive power in many
later heterodox systems, theistic and atheistic.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, it is solved in practice in terms of the fortunes
of priests and worshippers. At all stages of religious evolution
extreme ill-fortune tends to detach men from the cults that have failed
to bring them succour. Be it in the case of African indigenes slaying
their unsuccessful rain-doctor, Anglo-Saxon priests welcoming
Christianity as a surer source of income than their old worship, pagans
turning Christian at the fall of Julian, or Christians going
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>over to Islam at the sight of its
triumph&mdash;the simple primary motive of self-interest is always
potent on this as on other sides; and at all stages of Jewish history,
it is evident, there were many who held by Yahweh because they thought
he prospered them, or renounced him because he did not. And the very
vicissitude of things would breed a general skepticism.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e7059src" href="#xd25e7059" name=
"xd25e7059src">35</a> In Zephaniah (i, 12) there is a specific allusion
to those &ldquo;that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good,
neither will he do evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judaism is thus historically a series of socio-political selections
rather than a sequence of hereditary transmission. The first definite
and exclusive Yahwistic cult was an outcome of special political
conditions; and its priests would adhere to it in adversity insofar as
they had no other economic resort. Every return of sunshine, on the
other hand, would minister to faith; and while many Jews in the time of
Assyro-Babylonian ascendancy decided that Yahweh could not save, those
Yahwists who in the actual Captivity prospered commercially in the new
life would see in such prosperity a fresh proof of Yahweh&rsquo;s
support,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7067src" href="#xd25e7067" name=
"xd25e7067src">36</a> and would magnify his name and endow his priests
accordingly. For similar reasons, the most intense development of
Judaism occurs after the Maccabean revolt, when the military triumph of
the racial remnant over its oppressors inspired a new and enduring
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>On the other hand, foreign influences would chronically tend to
promote doubt, especially where the foreigner was not a mere successful
votary exalting his own God, but a sympathetic thinker questioning all
the Godisms alike. This consideration is a reason the more for
surmising a partly foreign source for the book of Job, where, as in the
passage cited from Zephaniah, there is no thought of one deity being
less potent than another, but rather an impeachment of divine rule in
terms of a conceptual monotheism. In any case, the book stands for more
than Jewish reverie; and where it is finally turned to an irrelevant
and commonplace reaffirmation of the goodness of deity, a certain
number of sincerer thinkers in all likelihood fell back on an
&ldquo;agnostic&rdquo; solution of the eternal problem.</p>
<p>In certain aspects the book of Job speaks for a further reach of
early freethinking than is seen in Ecclesiastes (Koheleth), which,
however, at its lower level of conviction, tells of an unbelief that
could not be overborne by any rhetoric. It unquestionably derives from
late foreign influences. It is true that even in the book of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>Malachi, which is commonly dated about 400
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>, there is angry mention of some who ask,
&ldquo;Where is the God of judgment?&rdquo; and say, &ldquo;It is vain
to serve God&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7082src" href=
"#xd25e7082" name="xd25e7082src">37</a> even as others had said it in
the days of Assyrian oppression;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7093src"
href="#xd25e7093" name="xd25e7093src">38</a> but in Malachi these
sentiments are actually associated with foreign influences, and in
Koheleth such influences are implicit. By an increasing number of
students, though not yet by common critical consent, the book is dated
about 200 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, when Greek influence was
stronger in Jewry than at any previous time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Gr&auml;tz even puts it as late as the time of Herod
the Great. But compare Dillon, p. 129; Tyler, <i>Ecclesiastes</i>,

with a confused and corrupted text. The German Prof. Bickell has framed
an ingenious and highly plausible theory to the effect that the present
incoherence of the text is mainly due to a misplacing of the leaves of

by Dillon, pp. 92&ndash;97; cp. Cheyne, <i>Job and Solomon</i>, p. 273

particular, is clearly the addition of a later hand&mdash;&ldquo;one of
the most timid and shuffling apologies ever penned&rdquo; (Dillon, p.
118, <i>note</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the thought of the book is, as Renan says, profoundly fatigued;
and the sombre avowals of the absence of divine moral government are
ill-balanced by sayings, probably interpolated by other hands, averring
an ultimate rectification even on earth. What remains unqualified is
the deliberate rejection of the belief in a future life, couched in
terms that imply the currency of the doctrine;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7143src" href="#xd25e7143" name="xd25e7143src">39</a> and the
deliberate caution against enthusiasm in religion. Belief in a powerful
but remote deity, with a minimum of worship and vows, is the
outstanding lesson.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7148src" href=

<p class="first">&ldquo;To me, Koheleth is not a theist in any vital

Judaism&#8202;&hellip;. It is grounded upon the rejection of the
Messianic expectations, and absolute disbelief in the solemn promises

</blockquote>
<p>That there was a good deal of this species of tired or stoical
semi-rationalism among the Jews of the Hellenistic period may be
inferred from various traces. The opening verses of the thirtieth
chapter of the book of Proverbs, attributed to <span class=
"sc">Agur</span>, son of Jakeh, are admittedly the expression of a
skeptic&rsquo;s conviction that God cannot be known,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e7165src" href="#xd25e7165" name="xd25e7165src">41</a> the
countervailing passages being plainly the additions of a believer.
Agur&rsquo;s utterances probably belong to the close of the third
century <span class="sc">B.C.</span> Here, as in Job, there are signs
of Arab influence;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7183src" href=
"#xd25e7183" name="xd25e7183src">42</a> but at a later period the main
source of skepticism for Israel was probably the Hellenistic
civilization. It is told in the Talmud that in the Maccabean period
there came into use the formula, &ldquo;Cursed be the man that
cherisheth swine; and cursed be the man that teacheth his son the
wisdom of the Greeks&rdquo;; and there is preserved the saying of Rabbi
Simeon, son of Gamaliel, that in his father&rsquo;s school five hundred
learnt the law, and five hundred the wisdom of the Greeks.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e7189src" href="#xd25e7189" name=
"xd25e7189src">43</a> Before Gamaliel, the Greek influence had affected
Jewish philosophic thought; and it is very probable that among the
Sadducees who resisted the doctrine of resurrection there were some
thinkers of the Epicurean school. To that school may have belonged the
unbelievers who are struck at in several Rabbinical passages which
account for the sin of Adam as beginning in a denial of the
omnipresence of God, and describe Cain as having said: &ldquo;There is
no judgment; there is no world to come, and there is no reward for the
just, and no punishment for the wicked.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7196src" href="#xd25e7196" name="xd25e7196src">44</a> But of
Greek or other atheism there is no direct trace in the Hebrew
literature;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7208src" href="#xd25e7208" name=
"xd25e7208src">45</a> and the rationalism of the Sadducees, who were
substantially the priestly party,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7211src"
href="#xd25e7211" name="xd25e7211src">46</a> was like the rationalism
of the Brahmans and the Egyptian priests&mdash;something esoteric and
withheld from the multitude. In the apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon, which
belongs to the first century <span class="sc">A.C.</span>, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>denial of immortality, so explicit in
Ecclesiastes, is treated as a proof of utter immorality, though the
deniers are not represented as atheists.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7228src" href="#xd25e7228" name="xd25e7228src">47</a> They thus
seem to have been still numerous, and the imputation of wholesale
immorality to them is of course not to be credited;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e7234src" href="#xd25e7234" name="xd25e7234src">48</a> but
there is no trace of any constructive teaching on their part.</p>
<p>So far as the literature shows, save for the confused
Judaic-Platonism of Philo of Alexandria, there is practically no
rational progress in Jewish thought after Koheleth till the time of
contact with revived Greek thought in Saracen Spain. The mass of the
people, in the usual way, are found gravitating to the fanatical and
the superstitious levels of the current creed. The book of Ruth,
written to resist the separatism of the post-Exilic theocracy,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e7243src" href="#xd25e7243" name=
"xd25e7243src">49</a> never altered the Jewish practice, though allowed
into the canon. The remarkable Levitical legislation providing for the
periodical restoration of the land to the poor never came into
operation,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7246src" href="#xd25e7246" name=
"xd25e7246src">50</a> any more than the very different provision giving
land and cities to the children of Aaron and the Levites. None of the
more rationalistic writings in the canon seems ever to have counted for
much in the national life. To conceive of &ldquo;Israel,&rdquo; in the
fashion still prevalent, as being typified in the monotheistic
prophets, whatever their date, is as complete a misconception as it
would be to see in Mr. Ruskin the expression of the everyday ethic of
commercial England. The anti-sacrificial and universalist teachings in
the prophets and in the Psalms never affected, for the people at large,
the sacrificial and localized worship at Jerusalem; though they may
have been esoterically received by some of the priestly or learned
class there, and though they may have promoted a continual exodus of
the less fanatical types, who turned to other civilizations. Despite
the resistance of the Sadducees and the teaching of Job and
Ecclesiastes, the belief in a resurrection rapidly gained
ground<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7252src" href="#xd25e7252" name=
"xd25e7252src">51</a> in the two or three centuries before the rise of
Jesuism, and furnished a basis for the new creed; as did the Messianic
hope and the belief in a speedy ending of the world, with both of which
Jewish fanaticism sustained itself under the long frustration of
nationalistic faith before the Maccabean interlude and after the Roman
conquest. It was in vain that the great teacher Hillel declared,
&ldquo;There is no Messiah for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118"
href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>Israel&rdquo;; the rest of
the race persisted in cherishing the dream.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7260src" href="#xd25e7260" name="xd25e7260src">52</a> With the
major hallucination thus in full possession, the subordinate species of
superstition flourished as in Egypt and India; so that at the beginning
of our era the Jews were among the most superstitious peoples in the
world.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7267src" href="#xd25e7267" name=
"xd25e7267src">53</a> When their monotheism was fully established, and
placed on an abstract footing by the destruction of the temple, it
seems to have had no bettering influence on the practical ethics of the
Gentiles, though it may have furthered the theistic tendency of the
Stoic philosophy. Juvenal exhibits to us the Jew proselyte at Rome as
refusing to show an unbeliever the way, or guide him to a
spring.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7279src" href="#xd25e7279" name=
"xd25e7279src">54</a> Sectarian monotheism was thus in part on a rather
lower ethical and intellectual<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7284src"
href="#xd25e7284" name="xd25e7284src">55</a> plane than the polytheism,
to say nothing of the Epicureanism or the Stoicism, of the society of
the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>It cannot even be said that the learned Rabbinical class carried on
a philosophic tradition, while the indigent multitude thus discredited
their creed. In the period after the fall of Jerusalem, the narrow
nationalism which had always ruled there seems to have been even
intensified. In the Talmud &ldquo;the most general representation of
the Divine Being is as the chief Rabbi of Heaven; the angelic host
being his assessors. The heavenly Sanhedrim takes the opinion of living
sages in cases of dispute. Of the twelve hours of the day three are
spent by God in study, three in the government of the world (or rather
in the exercise of mercy), three in providing food for the world, and
three in playing with Leviathan. But since the destruction of Jerusalem
all amusements were banished from the courts of heaven, and three hours
were employed in the instruction of those who had died in
infancy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7292src" href="#xd25e7292"
name="xd25e7292src">56</a> So little can a nominal monotheism avail, on
the basis of a completed Sacred Book, to keep thought sane when
freethought is lacking.</p>
<p>Finally, Judaism played in the world&rsquo;s thought the great
reactionary and obscurantist part by erecting into a dogma the
irrational conception that its deity made the universe &ldquo;out of
nothing.&rdquo; At the time of the redaction of the book of Genesis
this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>dogma had not been glimpsed: the Hebrew
conception was the Babylonian&mdash;that of a pre-existent Chaos put
into shape. But gradually, in the interests of monotheism, the
anti-scientific doctrine was evolved<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7308src" href="#xd25e7308" name="xd25e7308src">57</a> by way of
negative to that of the Gentiles; and where the great line of Ionian
thinkers passed on to the modern world the developed conception of an
eternal universe,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7320src" href="#xd25e7320"
name="xd25e7320src">58</a> Judaism passed on through Christianity, as
well as in its own &ldquo;philosophy,&rdquo; the contrary dogma, to bar
the way of later science. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=

<p class="first">The highest of all the ancient civilizations, that of

culture-forces;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7339src" href="#xd25e7339"

tradition of Oriental origins,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7388src"
href="#xd25e7388" name="xd25e7388src">6</a> it is clear that the higher
civilization of antiquity had Oriental (including in that term
Egyptian) roots.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7397src" href="#xd25e7397"
name="xd25e7397src">7</a> At no point do we find a &ldquo;pure&rdquo;
Greek civilization. Alike the &ldquo;Mycen&aelig;an&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; civilizations, as recovered for us by modern

implicated.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7403src" href="#xd25e7403" name=
"xd25e7403src">8</a> And in the historic period the connection remains
obvious. It matters not whether we hold the Phrygians and Karians of
history to have been originally an Aryan stock, related to the
Hellenes, and thus to have acted as intermediaries between Aryans and
Semites, or to have been originally Semites, with whom Greeks
intermingled.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7418src" href="#xd25e7418"
name="xd25e7418src">9</a> On either view, the intermediaries
represented Semitic influences, which they passed on to the
Greek-speaking races, though they in turn developed <span class=

lines common to them and the Semites.<a class="noteref" id=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">As to the obvious Asiatic influences on historic Greek
civilization, compare Winwood Reade, <i>The Martyrdom of Man</i>, 1872,
p. 64; Von Ihering, <i lang="de">Vorgeschichte der

1858, pp. 40&ndash;41; Bury, introd. p. 3. It seems clear that the
Egyptian influence is greatly overstated by Herodotos (ii. 49&ndash;52,
etc.), who indeed avows that he is but repeating what the Egyptians
affirm. The Egyptian priests made their claim in the spirit in which
the Jews later made theirs. Herodotos, besides, would prefer an
Egyptian to an Asiatic derivation, and so would his audience. But it
must not be overlooked that there was an Egyptian influence in the
&ldquo;Minoan&rdquo; period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Hellenistic enthusiasm has led a series of eminent scholars to
carry so far their resistance to the tradition of Oriental
beginnings<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7473src" href="#xd25e7473" name=
"xd25e7473src">11</a> as to take up the position that Greek thought is
&ldquo;autochthonous.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7479src" href=
"#xd25e7479" name="xd25e7479src">12</a> If it were, it could not
conceivably have progressed as it did. Only the tenacious psychological
prejudice as to race-characters and racial &ldquo;genius&rdquo; could
thus long detain so many students at a point of view so much more
nearly related to supernaturalism than to science. It is safe to say
that if any people is ever seen to progress in thought, art, and life,
with measurable rapidity, its progress is due to the reactions of
foreign intercourse. The primary civilizations, or what pass for such,
as those of Akkad and Egypt, are immeasurably slow in accumulating
culture-material; the relatively rapid developments always involve the
stimulus of old cultures upon a new and vigorous civilization,
well-placed for social evolution for the time being. There is no point
in early Greek evolution, so far as we have documentary trace of it, at
which foreign impact or stimulus is not either patent or
inferrible.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7504src" href="#xd25e7504" name=
"xd25e7504src">13</a> In the very dawn of history the Greeks are found
to be a composite stock,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7507src" href=
"#xd25e7507" name="xd25e7507src">14</a> growing still more composite;
and the very beginnings of its higher culture are traced to the
non-Grecian people of Thrace,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7510src" href=
"#xd25e7510" name="xd25e7510src">15</a> who worshipped the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>Muses. As seen by Herodotos and Thucydides,
&ldquo;the original Hellenes were a particular conquering tribe of
great prestige, which attracted the surrounding tribes to follow it,
imitate it, and call themselves by its name. The Spartans were, to
Herodotos, Hellenic; the Athenians, on the other hand, were not. They
were Pelasgian, but by a certain time &lsquo;changed into Hellenes and
learnt their language.&rsquo; In historical times we cannot really find
any tribe of pure Hellenes in existence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7524src" href="#xd25e7524" name="xd25e7524src">16</a> The later
supremacy of the Greek culture is thus to be explained in terms not of
an abnormal &ldquo;Greek genius,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7530src" href="#xd25e7530" name="xd25e7530src">17</a> but of the
special evolution of intelligence in the <i>Greek-speaking</i> stock,
firstly through constant crossing with others, and secondarily through
its furtherance by the special social conditions of the more
progressive Greek city-states, of which conditions the most important
were their geographical dividedness and their own consequent
competition and interaction.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7539src" href=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The whole problem of Oriental &ldquo;influence&rdquo;
has been obscured, and the solution retarded, by the old academic habit
of discussing questions of mental evolution <i lang="la">in vacuo</i>.
Even the reaction against idolatrous Hellenism proceeded without due
regard to historical sequence; and the return reaction against that is
still somewhat lacking in breadth of inference. There has been too much
on one side of assumption as to early Oriental achievement; and too
much tendency on the other to assume that the positing of an
&ldquo;influence&rdquo; on the Greeks is a disparagement of the
&ldquo;Greek mind.&rdquo; The superiority of that in its later
evolution seems too obvious to need affirming. But that hardly
justifies so able a writer as Professor Burnet in concluding (<i>Early
Greek Philosophy</i>, 2nd ed. introd. pp. 22&ndash;23) that
&ldquo;the&rdquo; Egyptians knew no more arithmetic than was learned by
their children in the schools; or in saying (<i>id.</i> p. 26) that
&ldquo;the&rdquo; Babylonians &ldquo;studied and recorded celestial
phenomena for what we call astrological purposes, <i>not</i> from any
scientific interest.&rdquo; How can we have the right to say that no
Babylonians had a scientific interest in the data? Such interest would
in the nature of the case miss the popular reproduction given to
astrological lore. But it might very well subsist.</p>
<p>Professor Burnet, albeit a really original investigator, has not
here had due regard to the early usage of collegiate or corporate
culture, in which arcane knowledge was reserved for the few. Thus he
writes (p. 26) concerning the Greeks that &ldquo;it was not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>till the time of Plato that even the names of
the planets were <i>known</i>.&rdquo; Surely they must have been
&ldquo;known&rdquo; to some adepts long before: how else came they to
be accepted? As Professor Burnet himself notes (p. 34), &ldquo;in
almost every department of life we find that the corporation at first
is everything and the individual nothing. The peoples of the East
hardly got beyond this stage at all: their science, such as it is, is
anonymous, the inherited property of a caste or guild, and we still see
clearly in some cases that it was once the same among the
Hellenes.&rdquo; Is it not then probable that astronomical knowledge
was so ordered by Easterns, and passed on to Hellenes?</p>
<p>There still attaches to the investigation of early Greek philosophy
the drawback that the philosophical scholars do not properly posit the
question: What was the early Ionic Greek society like? How did the
Hellenes relate to the older polities and cultures which they found
there? Professor Burnet makes justifiable fun (p. 21, <i>note</i>) of
Dr. Gomperz&rsquo;s theory of the influence of &ldquo;native
brides&rdquo;; but he himself seems to argue that the Greeks could
learn nothing from the men they conquered, though he admits (p. 20)
their derivation of &ldquo;their art and many of their religious ideas
from the East.&rdquo; If religion, why not religious speculation,
leading to philosophy and science? This would be a more fruitful line
of inquiry than one based on the assumption that &ldquo;the&rdquo;
Babylonians went one way and &ldquo;the&rdquo; Greeks another. After
all, only a few in each race carried on the work of thought and
discovery. We do not say that &ldquo;the English&rdquo; wrote
Shakespeare. Why affirm always that &ldquo;the&rdquo; Greeks did
whatever great Greeks achieved?</p>
<p>On the immediate issue Professor Burnet incidentally concedes what
is required. After arguing that the East perhaps borrowed more from the
West than did the West from the East, he admits (p. 21): &ldquo;It
would, however, be quite another thing to say that Greek philosophy
originated quite independently of Oriental influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">By the tacit admission of one of the ablest opponents
of the theory of foreign influence, Hellenic religion as fixed by Homer
for the Hellenic world was partly determined by Asiatic influences.
Ottfried M&uuml;ller decided not only that Homer the man (in whose
personality he believed) was probably a Smyrnean, whether of
&AElig;olic or Ionic stock,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7580src" href=
"#xd25e7580" name="xd25e7580src">19</a> but that Homer&rsquo;s religion
must have represented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>a special selection from the
manifold Greek mythology, necessarily representing his local
bias.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7587src" href="#xd25e7587" name=
"xd25e7587src">20</a> Now, the Greek cults at Smyrna, as in the other
&AElig;olic and Ionic cities of Asia Minor, would be very likely to
reflect in some degree the influence of the Karian or other Asiatic
cults around them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7592src" href=
"#xd25e7592" name="xd25e7592src">21</a> The early Attic conquerors of
Miletos allowed the worship of the Karian Sun-God there to be carried
on by the old priests; and the Attic settlers of Ephesos in the same
way adopted the neighbouring worship of the Lydian Goddess (who became
the Artemis or &ldquo;Great Diana&rdquo; of the Ephesians), and
retained the ministry of the attendant priests and eunuchs.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e7595src" href="#xd25e7595" name=
"xd25e7595src">22</a> Smyrna was apparently not like these a mixed
community, but one founded by Achaians from the Peloponnesos; but the
genera] Ionic and &AElig;olic religious atmosphere, set up by common
sacrifices,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7605src" href="#xd25e7605" name=
"xd25e7605src">23</a> must have been represented in an epic brought
forth in that region. The Karian civilization had at one time spread
over a great part of the &AElig;gean, including Delos and
Cyprus.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7608src" href="#xd25e7608" name=
"xd25e7608src">24</a> Such a civilization must have affected that of
the Greek conquerors, who only on that basis became civilized
traders.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7614src" href="#xd25e7614" name=
"xd25e7614src">25</a></p>
<p>It is not necessary to ask how far exactly the influence may have
gone in the Iliad: the main point is that even at that stage of
comparatively simple Hellenism the Asiatic environment, Karian or
Phoenician, counted for something, whether in cosmogony or in
furthering the process of God-grouping, or in conveying the cult of
Cyprian Aphrodite,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7633src" href=
"#xd25e7633" name="xd25e7633src">26</a> or haply in lending some
characteristics to Zeus and Apollo and Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e7651src" href="#xd25e7651" name=
"xd25e7651src">27</a> an influence none the less real because the
genius of the poet or poets of the Iliad has given to the whole
Olympian group the artistic stamp of individuality which thenceforth
distinguishes the Gods of Greece from all others. Indeed, the very
creation of a graded hierarchy out of the independent local deities of
Greece, the marrying of the once isolated Pelasgic H&ecirc;r&ecirc; to
Zeus, the subordination to him of the once isolated Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;
and Apollo&mdash;all this tells of the influence of a Semitic world in
which each Baal had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span>his wife, and in which the monarchic system
developed on earth had been set up in heaven.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7662src" href="#xd25e7662" name="xd25e7662src">28</a> But soon
the Asiatic influence becomes still more clearly recognizable. There is
reason to hold with Schrader that the belief in a mildly blissful
future state, as seen even in the Odyssey<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7702src" href="#xd25e7702" name="xd25e7702src">29</a> and in the
<i>Theogony</i> ascribed to Hesiod,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7711src"
href="#xd25e7711" name="xd25e7711src">30</a> is &ldquo;a new belief
which is only to be understood in view of oriental tales and
teaching.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7714src" href="#xd25e7714"
name="xd25e7714src">31</a> In the <i>Theogony</i>, again, the Semitic
element increases,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7727src" href=
"#xd25e7727" name="xd25e7727src">32</a> Kronos being a Semitic
figure;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7733src" href="#xd25e7733" name=
"xd25e7733src">33</a> while Semel&ecirc;, if not Dionysos, appears to
be no less so.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7740src" href="#xd25e7740"
name="xd25e7740src">34</a> But we may further surmise that in Homer, to
begin with, the conception of Okeanos, the earth-surrounding
Ocean-stream, as the origin of all things,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7755src" href="#xd25e7755" name="xd25e7755src">35</a> comes from
some Semitic source; and that Hesiod&rsquo;s more complicated scheme of
origins from Chaos is a further borrowing of oriental
thought&mdash;both notions being found in ancient Babylonian lore,
whence the Hebrews derived their combination of Chaos and Ocean in the

<p class="first">Whatever be the determining conditions, it is clear
that the Homeric epos stands for a new growth of secular song, distinct
from the earlier poetry, which by tradition was &ldquo;either lyrical
or oracular.&rdquo; The poems ascribed to the pre-Homeric bards
&ldquo;were all short, and they were all strictly religious. In these
features they contrasted broadly with the epic school of Homer. Even
the hexameter metre seems not to have been used in these old hymns, and
was called a new invention of the Delphic priests.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e7820src" href="#xd25e7820" name="xd25e7820src">41</a> Still
further, the majority of these hymns are connected with mysteries
apparently ignored by Homer, or with the worship of Dionysos, which he
hardly knew.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7829src" href=
"#xd25e7829" name="xd25e7829src">42</a> Intermediate between the
earlier religious poetry and the Homeric epic, then, was a hexametric
verse, used by the Delphic priesthood; and to this order of poetry
belongs the <i>Theogony</i> which goes under the name of Hesiod, and
which is a sample of other and older works,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7838src" href="#xd25e7838" name="xd25e7838src">43</a> probably
composed by priests. And the distinctive mark of the Homeric epos is
that, framed as it was to entertain feudal chiefs and their courts, it
turned completely away from the sacerdotal norm and purpose.
&ldquo;Thus epic poetry, from having been purely religious, became
purely secular. After having treated men and heroes in subordination to
the Gods, it came to treat the Gods in relation to men. Indeed, it may
be said of Homer that in the image of man created he
God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7843src" href="#xd25e7843" name=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">As to the non-religiousness of the Homeric epics,
there is a division of critical opinion. Meyer insists (<i lang=
"de">Gesch. des Alt.</i> ii, 395) that, as contrasted with the earlier
religious poetry, &ldquo;the epic poetry is throughout secular
(<i>profan</i>); it aims at charming its hearers, not at propitiating
the Gods&rdquo;; and he further sees <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>in the whole Ionian
mood a certain cynical disillusionment (<i>id.</i> ii, 723). Cp. Benn,
<i>Philos. of Greece</i>, p. 40, citing Hegel. E. Curtius (<i>G. G.</i>
i, 126) goes so far as to ascribe a certain irony to the portraiture of
the Gods (Ionian Apollo excepted) in Homer, and to trace this to Ionian
levity. To the same cause he assigns the lack of any expression of a
sense of stigma attaching to murder. This sense he holds the Greek
people had, though Homer does not hint it. (Cp. Grote, i, 24, whose
inference Curtius implicitly impugns.) Girard (<i lang="fr">Le
Sentiment religieux en Gr&egrave;ce</i>, 1869), on the contrary,
appears to have no suspicion of any problem to solve, treating Homer as
unaffectedly religious. The same view is taken by Prof. Paul Decharme.
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">On chercherait vainement dans
<i>l&rsquo;Iliade</i> et dans <i>l&rsquo;Odyss&eacute;e</i> les

have a kind of balance of contrary opinions, German against French. Any
verdict on the problem must recognize on the one hand the possibilities
of na&iuml;ve credulity in an unlettered age, and on the other the
probability of critical perception on the part of a great poet. I have
seen both among Boers in South Africa. On the general question of the
mood of the Homeric poems compare Gilbert Murray, <i>Four Stages of
Greek Religion</i>, 1912, p. 77, and <i>Hist. of Anc. Greek Lit.</i>
pp. 34, 35; and A. Benn, <i>The Philosophy of Greece in Relation to the

<p>Still, it cannot be said that in the Iliad there is any clear hint
of religious skepticism, though the Gods are so wholly in the likeness
of men that the lower deities fight with heroes and are worsted, while
Zeus and H&ecirc;r&ecirc; quarrel like any earthly couple. In the
Odyssey there is a bare hint of possible speculation in the use of the
word <i>atheos</i>; but it is applied only in the phrase <span class=

supposed to have exercised a measure of relative freethought in
excluding from his song the more offensive myths about the
Gods,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7985src" href="#xd25e7985" name=
"xd25e7985src">49</a> but such exclusion may be sufficiently explained
on the score that the epopees were chanted in aristocratic dwellings,
in the presence of womenkind, without surmising any process of doubt on
the poet&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was inevitable that such a free treatment of
things hitherto sacred should not only affect the attitude of the lay
listener towards the current religion, but should react on the
religious consciousness. God-legends so fully thrust on secular
attention were bound to be discussed; and in the adaptations of myth
for liturgical purposes by <span class="sc">Stesichoros</span> (fl.
<i>circa</i> 600 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>) we appear to have the
first open trace of a critical revolt in the Greek world against
immoral or undignified myths.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8002src" href=
"#xd25e8002" name="xd25e8002src">50</a> In his work, it is fair to say,
we see &ldquo;the beginning of rationalism&rdquo;: &ldquo;the decisive
step is taken: once the understanding criticizes the sanctified
tradition, it raises itself to be the judge thereof; no longer the
common tradition but the individual conviction is the ground of
religious belief.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8008src" href=
"#xd25e8008" name="xd25e8008src">51</a> Religious, indeed, the process
still substantially is. It is to preserve the credit of Helena as a
Goddess that Stesichoros repudiates the Homeric account of
her,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8012src" href="#xd25e8012" name=
"xd25e8012src">52</a> somewhat in the spirit in which the framers of
the Hesiodic theogony manipulated the myths without rejecting them, or
the Hebrew redactors tampered with their text. But in Stesichoros there
is a new tendency to reject the myth altogether;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8021src" href="#xd25e8021" name="xd25e8021src">53</a> so that at
this stage freethought is still part of a process in which religious
feeling, pressed by an advancing ethical consciousness, instinctively
clears its standing ground.</p>
<p>It is in Pindar, however (518&ndash;442 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>), that we first find such a mental process plainly
avowed by a believer. In his first Olympic Ode he expressly declares
the need for bringing afterthought to bear on poetic lore, that so men
may speak nought unfitting of the Gods; and he protests that he will
never tell the tale of the blessed ones banqueting on human
flesh.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8029src" href="#xd25e8029" name=
"xd25e8029src">54</a> In the ninth Ode he again protests that his lips
must not speak blasphemously of such a thing as strife among the
immortals.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8034src" href="#xd25e8034" name=
"xd25e8034src">55</a> Here the critical <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>motive is ethical,
though, while repudiating one kind of scandal about the Gods, Pindar
placidly accepts others no less startling to the modern sense. His
critical revolt, in fact, is far from thoroughgoing, and suggests
rather a religious man&rsquo;s partial response to pressure from others
than any independent process of reflection.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8041src" href="#xd25e8041" name="xd25e8041src">56</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;He [Pindar] was honestly attached to the
national religion and to its varieties in old local cults. He lived a
somewhat sacerdotal life, labouring in honour of the Gods, and seeking
to spread a reverence for old traditional beliefs. He, moreover, shows
an acquaintance with Orphic rites and Pythagorean mysteries, which led
him to preach the doctrine of immortality, and of rewards and
punishments in the life hereafter. [<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The most
explicit fragment (<span class="trans" title=

however, not considered genuine by recent critics.]&hellip; He is
indeed more affected by the advance of freethinking than he imagines;
he borrows from the neologians the habit of rationalizing myths, and
explaining away immoral acts and motives in the Gods; but these things
are isolated attempts with him, and have no deep effect upon his
general thinking&rdquo; (Mahaffy, <i>Hist. of Greek Lit.</i> i,
213&ndash;14).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For such a development we are not, of course, forced to assume a
foreign influence: mere progress in refinement and in mental activity
could bring it about; yet none the less it is probable that foreign
influence did quicken the process. It is true that from the beginnings
of the literary period Greek thought played with a certain freedom on
myth, partly perhaps because the traditions visibly came from various
races, and there was no strong priesthood to ossify them. After Homer
and Hesiod, men looked back to those poets as shaping theology to their
own minds.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8065src" href="#xd25e8065" name=
"xd25e8065src">57</a> But all custom is conservative, and
Pindar&rsquo;s mind had that general cast. On the other hand, external
influence was forthcoming. The period of Pindar and &AElig;schylus
[525&ndash;455 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>] follows on one in which
Greek thought, stimulated on all sides, had taken the first great
stride in its advance beyond all antiquity. Egypt had been fully thrown
open to the Greeks in the reign of Psammetichos<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8071src" href="#xd25e8071" name="xd25e8071src">58</a> (650
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>); and a great historian, who contends that
the &ldquo;sheer inherent and expansive force&rdquo; of
&ldquo;the&rdquo; Greek intellect, &ldquo;aided but by no means either
impressed or provoked from without,&rdquo; was the true cause, yet
concedes that intercourse with Egypt &ldquo;enlarged the range of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>their thoughts and observations, while it also
imparted to them that vein of mysticism which overgrew the primitive
simplicity of the Homeric religion,&rdquo; and that from Asia Minor in
turn they had derived &ldquo;musical instruments and new laws of rhythm
and melody,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;violent and maddening religious
rites.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8080src" href="#xd25e8080"
name="xd25e8080src">59</a> And others making similar &agrave; priori
claims for the Greek intelligence are forced likewise to admit that the
mental transition between Homer and Herodotos cannot be explained save
in terms of &ldquo;the influence of other creeds, and the necessary
operation of altered circumstances and relations.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8083src" href="#xd25e8083" name=
"xd25e8083src">60</a> In the <i>Persae</i> of &AElig;schylus we even
catch a glimpse of direct contact with foreign skepticism;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8092src" href="#xd25e8092" name=
"xd25e8092src">61</a> and again in the <i>Agamemnon</i> there is a
reference to some impious one who denied that the Gods deigned to have
care of mortals.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8104src" href="#xd25e8104"
name="xd25e8104src">62</a> It seems unwarrantable to read as
&ldquo;ridicule of popular polytheism&rdquo; the passage in the same
tragedy:<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8110src" href="#xd25e8110" name=
"xd25e8110src">63</a> &ldquo;Zeus, whosoever he be; if this name be
well-pleasing to himself in invocation, by this do I name him.&rdquo;
It may more fitly be read<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8115src" href=
"#xd25e8115" name="xd25e8115src">64</a> as an echo of the saying of
Herakleitos that &ldquo;the Wise [= the Logos?] is unwilling and
willing to be called by the name of Zeus.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8121src" href="#xd25e8121" name="xd25e8121src">65</a> But in the
poet&rsquo;s thought, as revealed in the <i>Prometheus</i>, and in the
<i>Agamemnon</i> on the theme of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia, there has
occurred an ethical judgment of the older creeds, an approach to
pantheism, a rejection of anthropomorphism, and a growth of pessimism
that tells of their final insufficiency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The leaning to pantheism is established by the
discovery that the disputed lines, &ldquo;Zeus is sky, earth, and
heaven: Zeus is all things, yea, greater than all things&rdquo; (Frag.
443), belonged to the lost tragedy of the <i>Heliades</i> (Haigh,
<i>Tragic Drama of the Greeks</i>, 1896, p. 88). For the pessimism see
the <i>Prometheus</i>, 247&ndash;51. The anti-anthropomorphism is
further to be made out from the lines ascribed to &AElig;schylus by
Justin Martyr (<i>De Monarchia</i>, c. 2) and Clemens Alexandrinus
(<i>Stromata</i>, v, 14). They are expressly pantheistic; but their
genuineness is doubtful. The story that &AElig;schylus was nearly
killed by a theatre audience on the score that he had divulged part of
the mysteries in a tragedy (Haigh, <i>The Attic Theatre</i>, 1889, p.
316; <i>Tragic Drama</i>, pp. 49&ndash;50) does not seem to have
suggested to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>Aristotle, who tells it (<i>Nicomachean
Ethics</i>, iii, 2), any heterodox intention on the tragedian&rsquo;s
part; but it is hard to see an orthodox believer in the author either
of the <i>Prometheus</i>, wherein Zeus is posed as brutal might
crucifying innocence and beneficence, or of the <i>Agamemnon</i>, where
the father, perplexed in the extreme, can but fall back helplessly on
formulas about the all-sufficiency of Zeus when called upon to
sacrifice his daughter. Cp. Haigh, <i>Tragic Drama</i>, p. 86
<i>sq.</i> &ldquo;Some critics,&rdquo; says Mr. Haigh (p. 88),
&ldquo;have been led to imagine that there is in &AElig;schylus a
double Zeus&mdash;the ordinary God of the polytheistic religion and the
one omnipotent deity in whom he really believed. They suppose that he
had no genuine faith in the credibility of the popular legends, but
merely used them as a setting for his tragedies; and that his own
convictions were of a more philosophical type,&rdquo; as seen in the
pantheistic lines concerning Zeus. To this Mr. Haigh replies that it is
&ldquo;most improbable that there was any clear distinction in the mind
of &AElig;schylus&rdquo; between the two conceptions of Zeus; going on,
however, to admit that &ldquo;much, no doubt, he regarded as uncertain,
much as false. Even the name &lsquo;Zeus&rsquo; was to him a mere
convention.&rdquo; Mr. Haigh in this discussion does not attempt to
deal with the problem of the <i>Prometheus</i>.</p>
<p>The hesitations of the critics on this head are noteworthy. Karl
Ottfried M&uuml;ller, who is least himself in dealing with fundamental
issues of creed, evades the problem (<i>Lit. of Anc. Greece</i>, 1847,
p. 329) with the bald suggestion that &ldquo;&AElig;schylus, in his own
mind, must have felt how this severity [of Zeus], a necessary
accompaniment of the transition from the Titanic period to the
government of the Gods of Olympus, was to be reconciled with the mild
wisdom which he makes an attribute of Zeus in the subsequent ages of
the world. Consequently, the deviation from right &hellip; would all
lie on the side of Prometheus.&rdquo; This nugatory plea&mdash;which is
rightly rejected by Burckhardt (<i lang="de">Griech. Culturgesch.</i>
ii, 25)&mdash;is ineffectually backed by the argument that the friendly
Oceanides recur to the thought, &ldquo;Those only are wise who humbly
reverence Adrasteia (<i>Fate</i>)&rdquo;&mdash;as if the positing of a
supreme Fate were not a further belittlement of Zeus.</p>
<p>Other critics are similarly evasive. Patin (<i lang=
"fr">Eschyle</i>, &eacute;d. 1877, p. 250 <i>sq.</i>), noting the
vagaries of past criticism, hostile and other, avowedly leaves the play
an unsolved enigma, affirming only the commonly asserted
&ldquo;piety&rdquo; of &AElig;schylus. Girard (<i lang="fr">Le
sentiment religieux en Gr&egrave;ce</i>, pp. 425&ndash;29) does no
better, while dogmatically asserting that the poet is &ldquo;the Greek
faithful to the faith of his fathers, which he interprets with an
intelligent and emotional (<i lang="fr">&eacute;mue</i>)
veneration.&rdquo; Meyer (iii, &sect;&sect; 257&ndash;58) draws an
elaborate parallel between &AElig;schylus and Pindar, affirming in turn
the &ldquo;<span lang="de">tiefe Fr&ouml;mmigkeit</span>&rdquo; of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>former&mdash;and in turn leaves the enigma of
the <i>Prometheus</i> unsolved. Professor Decharme, rightly rejecting
the fanciful interpretations of Quinet and others who allegorize
Prometheus into humanity revolting against superstition, offers a very
unsatisfying explanation of his own (p. 107), which practically denies
that there is any problem to solve.</p>
<p>Prof. Mahaffy, with his more vivacious habit of thought, comes to
the evaded issue. &ldquo;How,&rdquo; he asks, &ldquo;did the Athenian
audience, who vehemently attacked the poet for divulging the mysteries,
tolerate such a drama? And still more, how did &AElig;schylus, a pious
and serious thinker, venture to bring such a subject on the stage with
a moral purpose?&rdquo; The answers suggested are: (1) that in all old
religions there are tolerated anomalous survivals; (2) that &ldquo;a
very extreme distortion of their Gods will not offend many who would
feel outraged at any open denial of them&rdquo;; (3) that all Greeks
longed for despotic power for themselves, and that &ldquo;no Athenian,
however he sympathized with Prometheus, would think of blaming Zeus for
&hellip; crushing all resistance to his will.&rdquo; But even if these
answers&mdash;of which the last is the most questionable&mdash;be
accepted, &ldquo;the question of the poet&rsquo;s intention is far more
difficult, and will probably never be satisfactorily answered.&rdquo;
Finally, we have this summing-up: &ldquo;&AElig;schylus was, indeed,
essentially a theologian &hellip; but, what is more honourable and
exceptional, he was so candid and honest a theologian that he did not
approach men&rsquo;s difficulties for the purpose of refuting them or
showing them weak and groundless. On the contrary, though an orthodox
and pious man, though clearly convinced of the goodness of Providence,
and of the profound truth of the religion of his fathers, he was ever
stating boldly the contradictions and anomalies in morals and in myths,
and thus naturally incurring the odium and suspicion of the
professional advocates of religion and their followers. He felt,
perhaps instinctively, that a vivid dramatic statement of these
problems in his tragedies was better moral education than vapid
platitudes about our ignorance, and about our difficulties being only
caused by the shortness of our sight&rdquo; (<i>Hist. of Greek Lit.</i>
i, 260&ndash;61, 273&ndash;74).</p>
<p>Here, despite the intelligent handling, the enigma is merely
transferred from the great tragedian&rsquo;s work to his character: it
is not solved. No solution is offered of the problem of the pantheism
of the fragment above cited, which is quite irreconcilable with any
orthodox belief in Greek religion, though such sayings are at times
repeated by unthinking believers, without recognition of their bearing.
That the pantheism is a philosophical element imported into the Greek
world from the Babylonian through the early Ionian thinkers seems to be
the historical fact (cp. Whittaker, as last cited): that the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>importation meant the dissolution of the
national faith for many thinking men seems to be no less true. It seems
finally permissible, then, to suggest that the &ldquo;piety&rdquo; of
&AElig;schylus was either discontinuous or a matter of artistic
rhetoric and public spirit, and that the <i>Prometheus</i> is a work of
profound and terrible irony, unburdening his mind of reveries that
religion could not conjure away. The discussion on the play has unduly
ignored the question of its date. It is, in all probability, one of the
latest of the works of &AElig;schylus (K. O. M&uuml;ller, <i>Lit. of
Anc. Greece</i>, p. 327; Haigh, <i>Tragic Drama</i>, p. 109).
M&uuml;ller points to the employment of the third actor&mdash;a late
development&mdash;and Haigh to the overshadowing of the choruses by the
dialogue; also to the mention (ll. 366&ndash;72) of the eruption of
Etna, which occurred in 475 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> This one
circumstance goes far to solve the dispute. Written near the end of the
poet&rsquo;s life the play belongs to the latest stages of his
thinking; and if it departs widely in its tone from the earlier plays,
the reasonable inference is that his ideas had undergone a change. The
<i>Agamemnon</i>, with its desolating problem, seems to be also one of
his later works. Rationalism, indeed, does not usually emerge in old
age, though Voltaire was deeply shaken in his theism by the earthquake
of Lisbon; but &AElig;schylus is unique even among men of genius; and
the highest flight of Greek drama may well stand for an abnormal
intellectual experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this primary entrance of critical doubt into drama we have one of
the sociological clues to the whole evolution of Greek thought. It has
been truly said that the constant action of the tragic stage, the
dramatic putting of arguments and rejoinders, <i>pros</i> and
<i>cons</i>&mdash;which in turn was a fruit of the actual daily
pleadings in the Athenian dikastery&mdash;was a manifold stimulus alike
to ethical feeling and to intellectual effort, such as no other ancient
civilization ever knew. &ldquo;The appropriate subject-matter of
tragedy is pregnant not only with ethical sympathy, but also with
ethical debate and speculation,&rdquo; to an extent unapproached in the
earlier lyric and gnomic poetry and the literature of aphorism and
precept. &ldquo;In place of unexpanded results, or the mere
communication of single-minded sentiment, we have even in
&AElig;schylus, the earliest of the great tragedians, a large latitude
of dissent and debate&mdash;a shifting point of view&mdash;a case
better or worse&mdash;and a divination of the future advent of
sovereign and instructed reason. It was through the intermediate stage
of tragedy that Grecian literature passed into the Rhetoric,
Dialectics, and Ethical speculation which marked the fifth century
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8247src"
href="#xd25e8247" name="xd25e8247src">66</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p>This development was indeed autochthonous, save insofar as the germ
of the tragic drama may have come from the East in the cult of
Dionysos, with its vinous dithyramb: the &ldquo;Greek intellect&rdquo;
assuredly did wonderful things at Athens, being placed, for a time, in
civic conditions peculiarly fitted for the economic evocation of
certain forms of genius. But the above-noted developments in Pindar and
in &AElig;schylus had been preceded by the great florescence of early
Ionian philosophy in the sixth century, a growth which constrains us to
look once more to Asia Minor for a vital fructification of the Greek
inner life, of a kind that Athenian institutions could not in
themselves evoke. For while drama flourished supremely at Athens,
science and philosophy grew up elsewhere, centuries before Athens had a
philosopher of note; and all the notable beginnings of Hellenic
freethought occurred outside of Hellas proper.</p>

<p class="first">The Greeks varied from the general type of
culture-evolution seen in India, Persia, Egypt, and Babylon, and
approximated somewhat to that of ancient China, in that their higher
thinking was done not by an order of priests pledged to cults, but by
independent laymen. In Greece, as in China, this line of development is
to be understood as a result of early political conditions&mdash;in
China, those of a multiplicity of independent feudal States; in Greece,
those of a multiplicity of City States, set up first by the
geographical structure of Hellas, and reproduced in the colonies of
Asia Minor and Magna Graecia by reason of the acquired ideal and the
normal state of commercial competition. To the last, many Greek cults
exhibited their original character as the <i lang="la">sacra</i> of
private families. Such conditions prevented the growth of a priestly
caste or organization.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8261src" href=
"#xd25e8261" name="xd25e8261src">67</a> Neither China nor Pagan Greece
was imperialized till there had arisen enough of rationalism to prevent
the rise of a powerful priesthood; and the later growth of a priestly
system in Greece in the Christian period is to be explained in terms
first of a positive social degeneration, accompanying a complete
transmutation of political life, and secondly of the imposition of a
new cult, on the popular plane, specially <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

model of the political system that adopted it. Under imperialism,
however, the two civilizations ultimately presented a singular parallel
of unprogressiveness.</p>
<p>In the great progressive period, the possible gains from the absence
of a priesthood are seen in course of realization. For the
Greek-speaking world in general there was no dogmatic body of teaching,
no written code of theology and moral law, no Sacred Book.<a class=

great epopees ascribed to Homer, indeed, had a certain Biblical status;
and the Homerids or other bards who recited them did what in them lay
to make the old poetry the standard of theological opinion; but they
too lacked organized influence, and could not hinder higher
thinking.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8305src" href="#xd25e8305" name=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is historically certain that Lydia had an ancient
and close historical connection with Babylonian and Assyrian
civilization, whether through the &ldquo;Hittites&rdquo; or otherwise
(Sayce, <i>Anc. Emp. of the East</i>, 1884, pp. 217&ndash;19; Curtius,
<i lang="de">Griech. Gesch.</i> i, 63, 207; Meyer, <i lang="de">Gesch.

1881, pp. 30, 37 <i>sq.</i> Cp. as to Armenia, Edwards, <i>The Witness
of Assyria</i>, 1893, p. 144); and in the seventh century the
commercial connection between Lydia and Ionia, long close, was
presumably friendly up to the time of the first attacks of the Lydian
Kings, and even afterwards (Herodotos i, 20&ndash;23), Alyattes having
made a treaty of peace with Miletos, which thereafter had peace during
his long reign. This brings us to the time of Thales (640&ndash;548
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>). At the same time, the Ionian settlers of
Miletos had from the first a close connection with the Karians (Herod.
i, 146, and above pp. 120&ndash;21), whose near affinity with the
Semites, at least in religion, is seen in their practice of cutting
their foreheads at festivals (<i>id.</i> ii, 61; cp. Grote, ed. 1888,
i, 27, <i>note</i>; E. Curtius, i, 36, 42; Busolt, i, 33; and Spiegel,
<i lang="de">Eranische Alterthumskunde</i>, i, 228). Thales was thus in
the direct sphere of Babylonian culture before the conquest of Cyrus;
and his Milesian pupils or successors, Anaximandros and Anaximenes,
stand for the same influences. Herakleitos in turn was of Ephesus, an
Ionian city in the same culture-sphere; Anaxagoras was of Klazomenai,
another Ionian city, as had been Hermotimos, of the same philosophic
school; the Eleatic school, founded by Xenophanes and carried on by
Parmenides and the elder Zeno, come from the same matrix, Elea having
been founded by exiles from Ionian Phokaia on its conquest by the
Persians; and Pythagoras, in turn, was of the Ionian city of Samos, in
the same sixth century. Finally, Protagoras and Demokritos were of
Abdera, an Ionian colony in Thrace; Leukippos, the teacher of
Demokritos, was either an Abderite, a Milesian, or an Elean; and
Archelaos, the pupil of Anaxagoras and a teacher of Sokrates, is said
to have been a Milesian. Wellhausen (<i>Israel</i>, p. 473 of vol. of
<i>Prolegomena</i>, Eng. tr.) has spoken of the rise of philosophy on
the &ldquo;threatened and actual political annihilation of Ionia&rdquo;
as corresponding to the rise of Hebrew prophecy on the menace and the
consummation of the Assyrian conquest. As regards Ionia, this may hold
in the sense that the stoppage of political freedom threw men back on
philosophy, as happened later at Athens. But Thales philosophized
before the Persian conquest.</p>

and neither theological nor poetical, though we cannot tell whether the
worship of a God of the Waters may not have been the origin of a
water-theory of the cosmos. The phrase attributed to him, &ldquo;that
all things are full of Gods,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8388src"
href="#xd25e8388" name="xd25e8388src">76</a> clearly meant that in his

matter not only came from but was resolvable into water; that all
phenomena were ruled by law or &ldquo;necessity&rdquo;; and that the
sun and planets (commonly regarded as deities) were bodies analogous to
the earth, which he held to be spherical but &ldquo;resting on
water.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8424src" href="#xd25e8424"
name="xd25e8424src">81</a> For the rest, he speculated in meteorology
and in astronomy, and is credited with having predicted a solar eclipse

analysis of consciousness and the cosmic process.</p>
<p>From this point Greek rationalism is continuous, despite reactions,
till the Roman conquest, Miletos figuring long as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>general source of skepticism. <span class=
"sc">Anaximandros</span> (610&ndash;547 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>),
pupil and companion of Thales, was like him an astronomer, geographer,
and physicist, seeking for a first principle (for which he may or may
not have invented the name<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8459src" href=
"#xd25e8459" name="xd25e8459src">87</a>); rejecting the idea of a
single primordial element such as water; affirming an infinite material
cause, without beginning and indestructible,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8462src" href="#xd25e8462" name="xd25e8462src">88</a> with an
infinite number of worlds; and&mdash;still showing the Chaldean
impulse&mdash;speculating remarkably on the descent of man from
something aquatic, as well as on the form and motion of the earth
(figured by him as a cylinder<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8472src" href=
"#xd25e8472" name="xd25e8472src">89</a>), the nature and motions of the
solar system, and thunder and lightning.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8475src" href="#xd25e8475" name="xd25e8475src">90</a> It seems
doubtful whether, as affirmed by Eudemus, he taught the doctrine of the
earth&rsquo;s motion; but that this doctrine was derived from the
Babylonian schools of astronomy is so probable that it may have been
accepted in Miletos in his day. Only by inferring a prior scientific
development of remarkable energy can we explain the striking force of
the sayings of Anaximandros which have come down to us. His doctrine of
evolution stands out for us to-day like the fragment of a great ruin,
hinting obscurely of a line of active thinkers. The thesis that man
must have descended from a different species because, &ldquo;while
other animals quickly found food for themselves, man alone requires a
long period of suckling: had he been originally such as he is now, he
could never have survived,&rdquo; is a quite masterly anticipation of
modern evolutionary science. We are left asking, how came an early
Ionian Greek to think thus, outgoing the assimilative power of the
later age of Aristotle? Only a long scientific evolution can readily
account for it; and only in the Mesopotamian world could such an
evolution have taken place.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8481src" href=
"#xd25e8481" name="xd25e8481src">91</a></p>
<p><span class="sc">Anaximenes</span> (fl. 548 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>), yet another Milesian, pupil or at least follower in
turn of Anaximandros, speculates similarly, making his infinite and
first principle the air, in which he conceives the earth to be
suspended; theorizes on the rainbow, earthquakes, the nature and the
revolution of the heavenly bodies (which, with the earth, he supposed
to be broad and flat); and affirms the eternity of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>motion and the perishableness of the
earth.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8493src" href="#xd25e8493" name=
"xd25e8493src">92</a> The Ionian thought of the time seems thus to have
been thoroughly absorbed in problems of natural origins, and only in
that connection to have been concerned with the problems of religion.
No dogma of divine creation blocked the way: the trouble was levity of
hypothesis or assent. Thales, following a Semitic lead, places the
source of all things in water. Anaximandros, perhaps following another,
but seeking a more abstract idea, posited an infinite, the source of
all things; and Anaximenes in turn reduces that infinite to the air, as
being the least material of things. He cannot have anticipated the
chemical conception of the reduction of all solids to gases: the thesis
was framed either &agrave; priori or in adaptation of priestly claims
for the deities of the elements; and others were to follow with the
guesses of earth and fire and heat and cold. Still, the speculation is
that of bold and far-grasping thinkers, and for these there can have
been no validity in the ordinary God-ideas of polytheism.</p>
<p>There is reason to think that these early &ldquo;schools&rdquo; of
thought were really constituted by men in some way banded
together,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8498src" href="#xd25e8498" name=
"xd25e8498src">93</a> thus supporting each other against the
conservatism of religious ignorance. The physicians were so organized;
the disciples of Pythagoras followed the same course; and in later
Greece we shall find the different philosophic sects formed into
societies or corporations<span class="corr" id="xd25e8504" title=
"Not in source">.</span> The first model was probably that of the
priestly corporation; and in a world in which many cults were
chronically disendowed it may well have been that the leisured old
priesthoods, philosophizing as we have seen those of India and Egypt
and Mesopotamia doing, played a primary part in initiating the work of
rational secular thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The recent work of Mr. F. M. Cornford, <i>From
Philosophy to Religion</i> (1912), puts forth an interesting and
ingenious theory to the effect that early Greek philosophy is a
reduction to abstract terms of the practice of totemistic tribes. On
this view, when the Gods are figured in Homer as subject to
<i>Moira</i> (Destiny), there has taken place an impersonation of
<i>Nomos</i>, or Law; and just as the divine cosmos or polity is a
reflection of the earthly, so the established conception of the
absolute compulsoriness of tribal law is translated into one of a Fate
which overrules the Gods (p. 40 <i>sq.</i>). So, when Anaximandros
posits the doctrine of four elements [he did not use the word, by the
way; that comes later; see Burnet, ch. i, p. 56, citing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>Diels], &ldquo;we observe that this type of
cosmic structure corresponds to that of a totemic tribe containing four
clans&rdquo; (p. 62). On the other hand, the totemistic stage had long
before been broken down. The &ldquo;notion of the group-soul&rdquo; had
given rise to the notion of God (p. 90); and the primitive
&ldquo;magical group&rdquo; had dissolved into a system of families (p.
93), with individual souls. On this prior accumulation of religious
material early philosophy works (p. 138).</p>
<p>It does not appear why, thus recognizing that totemism was at least
a long way behind in Thales&rsquo;s day, Mr. Cornford should trace the
Ionian four elements straight back to the problematic four clans of the
totemistic tribe. Dr. Frazer gives him no data whatever for Aryan
totemism; and the Ionian cities, like those of Mesopotamia and Egypt,
belong to the age of commerce and of monarchies. It would seem more
plausible, on Mr. Cornford&rsquo;s own premises, to trace the rival
theories of the four elements to religious philosophies set up by the
priests of four <i>Gods</i> of water, earth, air, and fire. If the
early philosophers &ldquo;had nothing but theology behind them&rdquo;
(p. 138), why not infer theolog<i>ies</i> for the old-established
deities of Mesopotamia? Mr. Cornford adds to the traditional factors
that of &ldquo;the temperaments of the individual philosophers, which
made one or other of those schemes the more congenial to them.&rdquo;
Following Dr. F. H. Bradley, he pronounces that &ldquo;almost all
philosophic arguments are invented afterwards, to recommend, or defend
from attack, conclusions which the philosopher was from the outset bent
on believing before he could think of any arguments at all. That is why
philosophical reasonings are so bad, so artificial, so
unconvincing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this very principle it is much more likely that the philosophic
cults of water, earth, air, and fire originated in the worships of Gods
of those elements, whose priests would tend to magnify their office. It
is hard to see how &ldquo;temperament&rdquo; could determine a
man&rsquo;s bias to an air-theory in preference to a water-theory. But
if the priests of Ea the Water-God and those of Bel the God of Air had
framed theories of the kind, it is conceivable that family or tribal
ties and traditions might set men upon developing the theory
quasi-philosophically when the alien Gods came to be recognized by
thinking men as mere names for the elements.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8534src" href="#xd25e8534" name="xd25e8534src">94</a> (Compare
Flaubert&rsquo;s <i>Salammb&ocirc;</i> as to the probable rivalry of
priests of the Sun and Moon.) A pantheistic view, again, arose as we
saw among various priesthoods in the monarchies where syncretism arose
out of political aggregations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is clear is that the religious or theistic basis had ceased to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>exist for many educated Greeks in that
environment. The old God-ideas have disappeared, and a quasi-scientific
attitude has been taken up. It is apparently conditioned, perhaps
fatally, by prior modes of thought; but it operates in disregard of
so-called religious needs, and negates the normal religious conception
of earthly government or providence. Nevertheless, it was not destined
to lead to the rationalization of popular thought; and only in a small
number of cases did the scientific thinkers deeply concern themselves
with the enlightenment of the mass.</p>
<p>In another Ionian thinker of that age, indeed, we find alongside of
physical and philosophical speculation on the universe the most direct
and explicit assault upon popular religion that ancient history
preserves. <span class="sc">Xenophanes</span> of Kolophon (?
570&ndash;470), a contemporary of Anaximandros, was forced by a Persian
invasion or by some revolution to leave his native city at the age of
twenty-five; and by his own account his doctrines, and inferribly his
life, had gone &ldquo;up and down Greece&rdquo;&mdash;in which we are
to include Magna Graecia&mdash;for sixty-seven years at the date of
writing of one of his poems.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8550src" href=
"#xd25e8550" name="xd25e8550src">95</a> This was presumably composed at
Elea (Hyela or Velia), founded about 536 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>,
on the western Italian coast, south of Paestum, by unsubduable
Phokaians seeking a new home after the Persian conquest, and after they
had been further defeated in the attempt to live as pirates in
Corsica.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8556src" href="#xd25e8556" name=
"xd25e8556src">96</a> Thither came the aged Xenophanes, perhaps also
seeking freedom. He seems to have lived hitherto as a rhapsode,
chanting his poems at the courts of tyrants as the Homerids did the
Iliad. It is hard indeed to conceive that his recitations included the
anti-religious passages which have come down to us; but his resort in
old age to the new community of Elea is itself a proof of a craving and
a need for free conditions of life.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8559src"
href="#xd25e8559" name="xd25e8559src">97</a></p>
<p>Setting out on his travels, doubtless, with the Ionian predilection
for a unitary philosophy, he had somewhere and somehow attained a
pantheism which transcended the concern for a &ldquo;first
principle&rdquo;&mdash;if, indeed, it was essentially distinct from the
doctrine of Anaximandros.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8570src" href=
"#xd25e8570" name="xd25e8570src">98</a> &ldquo;Looking wistfully upon
the whole heavens,&rdquo; says Aristotle,<a class="noteref" id=

affirms that unity is God.&rdquo; From the scattered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=

poem, <i>On Nature</i> (or <i>Natural Things</i>),<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e8590src" href="#xd25e8590" name="xd25e8590src">100</a> it is
hard to deduce any full conception of his philosophy; but it is clear
that it was monistic; and though most of his later interpreters have
acclaimed him as the herald of monotheism, it is only in terms of
pantheism that his various utterances can be reconciled. It is clearly
in that sense that Aristotle and Plato<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8593src" href="#xd25e8593" name="xd25e8593src">101</a>
commemorate him as the first of the Eleatic monists. Repeatedly he
speaks of &ldquo;the Gods&rdquo; as well as of &ldquo;God&rdquo;; and
he even inculcates the respectful worship of them.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e8601src" href="#xd25e8601" name="xd25e8601src">102</a> The
solution seems to be that he thinks of the forces and phenomena of
Nature in the early way as Gods or Powers, but resolves them in turn
into a whole which includes all forms of power and intelligence, but is
not to be conceived as either physically or mentally anthropomorphic.
&ldquo;His contemporaries would have been more likely to call
Xenophanes an atheist than anything else.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The common verdict of the historians of philosophy,
who find in Xenophanes an early and elevated doctrine of
&ldquo;Monotheism,&rdquo; is closely tested by J. Freudenthal, <i lang=
"de">Ueber die Theologie des Xenophanes</i>, 1886. As he shows, the
bulk of them (cited by him, pp. 2&ndash;7) do violence to
Xenophanes&rsquo;s language in making him out the proclaimer of a
monotheistic doctrine to a polytheistic world. That he was essentially
a pantheist is now recognized by a number of writers. Cp. Windelband,
as cited, p. 48; Decharme, as cited, p. 46 <i>sq.</i> Br&eacute;ton,
<i lang="fr">Po&eacute;sie philos. en Gr&egrave;ce</i>, pp. 47, 64
<i>sq.</i>, had maintained the point, against Cousin, in 1882, before
Freudenthal. But Freudenthal in turn <span class="corr" id="xd25e8622"
title="Source: gloses">glosses</span> part of the problem in ascribing
to Xenophanes an acceptance of polytheism (cp. Burnet, p. 142), which
kept him from molestation throughout his life; whereas Anaxagoras, who
had never attacked popular belief with the directness of Xenophanes,
was prosecuted for atheism. Anaxagoras was of a later age, dwelling in
an Athens in which popular prejudice took readily to persecution, and
political malice resorted readily to religious pretences. Xenophanes
could hardly have published with impunity in Periklean Athens his
stinging impeachments of current God-ideas; and it remains problematic
whether he ever proclaimed them in face of the multitude. It is only
from long subsequent students that we get them as quotations from his
poetry; there is no record of their effect on his contemporaries. That
his God-idea was pantheistic is sufficiently established by his attacks
on anthropomorphism, taken in connection with his doctrine of the
All.</p>

<p>Whether as teaching meant for public currency or as a philosophic
message for the few, the pantheism of Xenophanes expressed itself in an
attack on anthropomorphic religion, no less direct and much more
ratiocinative than that of any Hebrew prophet upon idolatry.
&ldquo;Mortals,&rdquo; he wrote, in a famous passage, &ldquo;suppose
that the Gods are born, and wear man&rsquo;s clothing,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8629src" href="#xd25e8629" name=
"xd25e8629src">104</a> and have voice and body. But if cattle or lions
had hands, so as to paint with their hands and make works of art as men
do, they would paint their Gods and give them bodies like their
own&mdash;horses like horses, cattle like cattle.&rdquo; And again:
&ldquo;Ethiopians make their Gods black and snub-nosed; the Thracians
say theirs have reddish hair and blue eyes; so also they conceive the
spirits of the Gods to be like themselves.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8632src" href="#xd25e8632" name="xd25e8632src">105</a> On Homer
and Hesiod, the myth-singers, his attack is no less stringent:
&ldquo;They attributed to the Gods all things that with men are of
ill-fame and blame; they told of them countless nefarious
things&mdash;thefts, adulteries, and deception of each
other.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8638src" href="#xd25e8638"
name="xd25e8638src">106</a> It is recorded of him further that, like
Epicurus, he absolutely rejected all divination.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8641src" href="#xd25e8641" name="xd25e8641src">107</a> And when
the Eleans, perhaps somewhat shaken by such criticism, asked him
whether they should sacrifice and sing a dirge to Leukothea, the
child-bereft Sea-Goddess, he bade them not to sing a dirge if they
thought her divine, and not to sacrifice if she were human.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8650src" href="#xd25e8650" name=
"xd25e8650src">108</a></p>
<p>Beside this ringing radicalism, not yet out of date, the physics of
the Eleatic freethinker is less noticeable. His resort to earth as a
material first principle was but another guess or disguised theosophy
added to those of his predecessors, and has no philosophic congruity
with his pantheism. It is interesting to find him reasoning from
fossil-marks that what was now land had once been sea-covered, and been
left mud; and that the moon is probably inhabited.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e8658src" href="#xd25e8658" name="xd25e8658src">109</a> Yet,
with all this alertness of speculation, Xenophanes sounds the note of
merely negative skepticism which, for lack of fruitful scientific
research, was to become more and more common in Greek thought:<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8670src" href="#xd25e8670" name=
"xd25e8670src">110</a> &ldquo;no man,&rdquo; he avows in one verse,

"xd25e8676src">111</a> More fruitful was his pantheism or pankosmism.

id="xd25e8690src" href="#xd25e8690" name="xd25e8690src">112</a>
&ldquo;It was thus from Xenophanes that the doctrine of Pankosmism
first obtained introduction into Greek philosophy, recognizing nothing
real except the universe as an indivisible and unchangeable
whole.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8696src" href="#xd25e8696"
name="xd25e8696src">113</a> His negative skepticism might have guarded
later Hellenes against baseless cosmogony-making if they had been
capable of a systematic intellectual development. His sagacity, too,
appears in his protest<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8699src" href=
"#xd25e8699" name="xd25e8699src">114</a> against that extravagant
worship of the athlete which from first to last kept popular Greek
life-philosophy unprogressive. But here least of all was he listened
to.</p>
<p>It is after a generation of such persistent questioning of Nature
and custom by pioneer Greeks that we find in <span class=
"sc">Herakleitos</span> of Ephesus (fl. 500 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>)&mdash;still in the Ionian culture-sphere&mdash;a
positive and unsparing criticism of the prevailing beliefs. No sage
among the Ionians (who had already produced a series of powerful
thinkers) left a deeper impression than he of massive force and
piercing intensity: above all of the gnomic utterances of his age, his
have the ring of character and the edge of personality; and the
gossiping Diogenes, after setting out by calling him the most arrogant
of men, concedes that the brevity and weight of his expression are not
to be matched. It was due rather to this, probably, than to his
metaphysic&mdash;though that has an arresting quality&mdash;that there
grew up a school of Herakliteans calling themselves by his name. And
though doubt attaches to some of his sayings, and even to his date,
there can be small question that he was mordantly freethinking, though
a man of royal descent. He has stern sayings about &ldquo;bringing
forth untrustworthy witnesses to confirm disputed points,&rdquo; and
about eyes and ears being &ldquo;bad witnesses for men, when their
souls lack understanding.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8710src"

&ldquo;character is a man&rsquo;s d&aelig;mon,&rdquo; seems to be the
definite assertion of rationalism in affairs as against the creed of
special providences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A confusion of tradition has arisen between the early
Herakleitos, &ldquo;the Obscure,&rdquo; and the similarly-named writer
of the first century of our era, who was either one Herakleides or one
using the name of Herakleitos. As the later writer certainly
allegorized Homer&mdash;reducing Apollo to the Sun, Athen&ecirc; to
Thought, and so on&mdash;and claimed thus to free him from the charge
of impiety, it seems highly probable that it is from him that the
scholiast on the Iliad, xv, 18, cites the passage scolding the atheists
who attacked the Homeric myths. The theme and the tone do not belong to
500 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, when only the boldest&mdash;as
Herakleitos&mdash;would be likely to attack Homer, and when there is no
other literary trace of atheism. Grote, however (i, 374, <i>note</i>),
cites the passages without comment as referring to the early
philosopher, who is much more probably credited, as above, with
denouncing Homer himself. Concerning the later Herakleitos or
Herakleides, see Dr. Hatch&rsquo;s Hibbert Lectures on <i>The Influence
of Greek Ideas and Usages upon the Christian Church</i>, 1890, pp. 61,
62.</p>
<p>But even apart from the confusion with the late Herakleides, there
is difficulty in settling the period of the Ephesian thinker. Diogenes
La&euml;rtius states that he flourished about the 69th Olympiad
(504&ndash;500 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>). Another account,
preserved by Eusebius, places him in the 80th or 81st Olympiad, in the
infancy of Sokrates, and for this date there are other grounds
(Ueberweg, i, 40); but yet other evidences carry us back to the
earlier. As Diogenes notes five writers of the name&mdash;two being
poets, one a historian, and one a &ldquo;serio-comic&rdquo;
personage&mdash;and there is record of many other men named Herakleitos
and several Herakleides, there is considerable room for false
attributions. The statement of Diogenes that the Ephesian was
&ldquo;wont to call opinion the sacred disease&rdquo; (i, 6, &sect; 7)
is commonly relegated to the spurious sayings of Herakleitos, and it
suggests the last mentioned of his namesakes. But see Max M&uuml;ller,
Hibbert Lectures <i>on Indian Religion</i>, p. 6, for the opinion that
it is genuine, and that by &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; was meant
&ldquo;religion.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>The saying, says Dr. M&uuml;ller,
&ldquo;seems to me to have the massive, full, and noble ring of
Herakleitos.&rdquo; It is hardly for rationalists to demur.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much discussion has been set up by the common attribution to
Herakleitos in antiquity of the doctrine of the ultimate conflagration
of all things. But for this there is no ground in any actual passage
preserved from his works; and it appears to have been a mere
misconception of his doctrine in regard to Fire. His monistic doctrine
was, in brief, that all the opposing and contrasted things in the
universe, heat and cold, day and night, evil and good, imply each
other, and exist only in the relation of contrast; and he conceived
fire as something in which opposites were solved.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8788src" href="#xd25e8788" name="xd25e8788src">124</a> Upon this
stroke of mysticism was concentrated the discussion which might
usefully have been turned on his criticism of popular religion; his
negative wisdom was substantially ignored, and his obscure speculation,
treated as his main contribution to thought, was misunderstood and
perverted.</p>
<p>A limit was doubtless soon set to free speech even in Elea; and the
Eleatic school after Xenophanes, in the hands of his pupil <span class=
"sc">Parmenides</span> (fl. 500 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>),
<span class="sc">Zeno</span> (fl. 464), <span class=
"sc">Melissos</span> of Samos (fl. 444), and their successors, is found
turning first to deep metaphysic and then to verbal dialectic, to
discussion on being and not being, the impossibility of motion, and the
trick-problem of Achilles and the tortoise. It is conceivable that
thought took these lines because others were socially closed.
Parmenides, a notably philosophic spirit (whom Plato, meeting him in
youth, felt to have &ldquo;an exceptionally wonderful depth of
mind,&rdquo; but regarded as a man to be feared as well as
reverenced),<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8805src" href="#xd25e8805"
name="xd25e8805src">125</a> made short work of the counter-sense of not
being, but does not seem to have dealt at close quarters with popular
creeds. Melissos, a man of action, who led a successful sally to
capture the Athenian fleet,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8825src" href=
"#xd25e8825" name="xd25e8825src">126</a> was apparently the most
pronounced freethinker of the three named,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8831src" href="#xd25e8831" name="xd25e8831src">127</a> in that he
said of the Gods &ldquo;there was no need to define them, since there
was no knowledge of them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8840src"
href="#xd25e8840" name="xd25e8840src">128</a> Such utterance could not
be carried far in any Greek community; and there lacked the spirit of
patient research which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>might have fruitfully developed
the notable hypothesis of Parmenides that the earth is spherical in
form.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8845src" href="#xd25e8845" name=
"xd25e8845src">129</a> But he too was a loose guesser, adding
categories of fire and earth and heat and cold to the formative and
material &ldquo;principles&rdquo; of his predecessors; and where he
divagated weaker minds could not but lose themselves. From Melissos and
Parmenides there is accordingly a rapid descent in philosophy to
professional verbalism, popular life the while proceeding on the old
levels.</p>
<p>It was in this epoch of declining energy and declining freedom that
there grew up the nugatory doctrine, associated with the Eleatic
school,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8850src" href="#xd25e8850" name=
"xd25e8850src">130</a> that the only realities are mental,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8856src" href="#xd25e8856" name=
"xd25e8856src">131</a> a formula which eluded at once the problems of
Nature and the crudities of religion, and so made its fortune with the
idle educated class. Meant to support the cause of reason, it was soon
turned, as every slackly-held doctrine must be, to a different account.
In the hands of Plato it developed into the doctrine of ideas, which in
the later Christian world was to play so large a part, as
&ldquo;Realism,&rdquo; in checking scientific thought; and in Greece it
fatally fostered the indolent evasion of research in physics.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8865src" href="#xd25e8865" name=
"xd25e8865src">132</a> Ultimately this made for supernaturalism, which
had never been discarded by the main body even of rationalizing
thinkers.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8868src" href="#xd25e8868" name=
"xd25e8868src">133</a> Thus the geographer and historian <span class=
"sc">Hekataios</span> of Miletos (fl. 500 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>), living at the great centre of rationalism, while
rejecting the mass of Greek fables as &ldquo;ridiculous,&rdquo; and
proceeding in a fashion long popular to translate them into historical
facts, yet affected, in the poetic Greek fashion, to be of divine
descent.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8878src" href="#xd25e8878" name=
"xd25e8878src">134</a> At the same time he held by such fables as that
of the floating island in the Nile and that of the supernormal
Hyperboreans. This blending of old and new habits of mind is indeed
perhaps the strongest ground for affirming the genuineness of his
fragments, which has been disputed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8881src"
href="#xd25e8881" name="xd25e8881src">135</a> But from his time forward
there are many signs of a broad movement of criticism, doubt, inquiry,
and reconstruction, involving an extensive discussion of historical as
well as religious tradition.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8884src" href=
"#xd25e8884" name="xd25e8884src">136</a> There had begun, in short, for
the rapidly-developing Greeks, a &ldquo;discovery of man&rdquo; such as
is ascribed in later times to the age of the Italian Renaissance. In
the next generation came the father of humanists, Herodotos, who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>implicitly carries the process of discrimination
still further than did Hekataios; while Sophocles [496&ndash;405
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>], without ever challenging popular faith,
whether implicitly as did &AElig;schylus, or explicitly as did
Euripides, &ldquo;brought down the drama from the skies to the earth;
and the drama still follows the course which Sophocles first marked out
for it. It was on the Gods, the struggles of the Gods, and on destiny
that &AElig;schylus dwelt; it is with man that Sophocles is
concerned.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8895src" href="#xd25e8895"
name="xd25e8895src">137</a></p>
<p>Still, there was only to be a partial enlightenment of the race,
such as we have seen occurring, perhaps about the same period, in
India. Sophocles, even while dramatizing the cruel consequences of
Greek religion, never made any sign of being delivered from the
ordinary Greek conceptions of deity, or gave any help to wiser thought.
The social difference between Greece and the monarchic civilizations
was after all only one of degree: there, as elsewhere, the social
problem was finally unsolved; and the limits to Greek progress were
soon approached. But the evolution went far in many places, and it is
profoundly interesting to trace it.</p>

<p class="first">Compared with the early Milesians and with Xenophanes,
the elusive <span class="sc">Pythagoras</span> (fl. 540&ndash;510
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>) is not so much a rationalistic as a
theosophic freethinker; but to freethought his name belongs insofar as
the system connected with it did rationalize, and discarded mythology.
If the biographic data be in any degree trustworthy, it starts like
Milesian speculation from oriental precedents.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8914src" href="#xd25e8914" name="xd25e8914src">138</a> Pythagoras
was of Samos in the &AElig;gean; and the traditions have it that he was
a pupil of Pherekydes the Syrian, and that before settling at
Kr&ocirc;ton, in Italy, he travelled in Egypt, and had intercourse with
the Chaldean Magi. Some parts of the Pythagorean code of life, at
least, point to an eastern derivation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The striking resemblance between the doctrine and
practice of the Pythagoreans and those of the Jewish Essenes has led
Zeller to argue (<i lang="de">Philos. der Griechen</i>, Th. iii, Abth.
2) that the latter were a branch of the former. Bishop Lightfoot, on
the other hand, noting that the Essenes did not hold the specially
prominent Pythagorean doctrines of numbers and of the transmigration of
souls, traces Essenism to Zoroastrian influence (Ed. of
<i>Colossians</i>, App. on the Essenes, pp. 150&ndash;51; rep. in
<i>Dissertations on the Apostolic Age</i>, 1892, pp. 369&ndash;72).
This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>raises the issue whether both Pythagoreanism and
Essenism were not of Persian derivation; and Dr. Sch&uuml;rer
(<i>Jewish People in the Time of Jesus</i>, Eng. tr. Div. II, vol. ii,
p. 218) pronounces in favour of an oriental origin for both. The new
connection between Persia and Ionia just at or before the time of
Pythagoras (fl. 530 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>) squares with this
view; but it is further to be noted that the phenomenon of monasticism,
common to Pythagoreans and Essenes, arises in Buddhism about the
Pythagorean period; and as it is hardly likely that Buddhism in the
sixth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span> reached Asia Minor, there
remains the possibility of some special diffusion of the new ideal from
the Babylonian sphere after the conquest by Cyrus, there being no trace
of a Persian monastic system. The resemblances to Orphicism likewise
suggest a Babylonian source, as does the doctrine of numbers, which is
not Zoroastrian. As to Buddhism, the argument for a Buddhist origin of
Essenism shortly before our era (cp. A. Lillie, <i>Buddhism in
Christendom</i> and <i>The Influence of Buddhism on Primitive
Christianity</i>; E. Bunsen, <i>The Angel-Messiah; or, Buddhists,
Essenes, and Christians</i>&mdash;all three to be read with much
caution) does not meet the case of the Pythagorean precedents for
Essenism. Prof. Burnet (<i>Early Greek Philos.</i> 2nd ed. p. 102)
notes close <i>Indian</i> parallels to Pythagoreanism, but overlooks
the intermediate Persian parallels, and falls back very unnecessarily
on the bald notion that &ldquo;the two systems were independently
evolved from the same primitive systems.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As regards the mystic doctrine that numbers are, as it were, the
moving principle in the cosmos&mdash;another thesis not unlikely to
arise in that Babylonian world whence came the whole system of numbers
for the later ancients<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8960src" href=
"#xd25e8960" name="xd25e8960src">139</a>&mdash;we can but pronounce it
a development of thought <i lang="la">in vacuo</i>, and look further
for the source of Pythagorean influence in the moral and social code of
the movement, in its science, in its pantheism,<a class="noteref" id=

contradictory dualism,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8969src" href=
"#xd25e8969" name="xd25e8969src">141</a> and perhaps in its doctrine of
transmigration of souls. On the side of natural science, its
absurdities<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8974src" href="#xd25e8974" name=

specially ascribed to him, though current in the East long before his
day. In the fragments ascribed to him is affirmed, in divergence from

seems to have been an innovator.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9047src"
href="#xd25e9047" name="xd25e9047src">151</a> In any case, the

conceived the earth as a sphere.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9053src"
href="#xd25e9053" name="xd25e9053src">152</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is noteworthy, however, that in conjecturing that
the whole solar system moves round a &ldquo;central fire,&rdquo;
Pythagoras carried his thought nearly as far as the moderns. The
fanciful side of his system is seen in his hypothesis of a
counter-earth (<i>Anti-chthon</i>) invented to bring up the number of
celestial bodies in our system to ten, the &ldquo;complete&rdquo;
number. (Berry, as cited.) Narrien (p. 163) misses this simple
explanation of the idea.</p>

was only too easy. He had laid down, as so many another moralist, that
justice consisted in reciprocity; but he taught of virtue in terms of
his theory of numbers<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9093src" href=

<p class="first">An opposite view of the Pythagorean evolution is taken
by Professor Burnet. He is satisfied that the long list of the
Pythagorean taboos, which he rightly pronounces to be &ldquo;of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=

not at all the subtle &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; which they were latterly
represented to be, were really the lore of Pythagoras. It is not easy
thus to conceive a thinker of the great Ionian age as holding by
thoroughly primitive superstitions. Perhaps the solution lies in
Aristotle&rsquo;s statement that Pythagoras was first a mathematician,
and only in later life a Pherekydean miracle-monger (Burnet, p. 107,
<i>note</i> 3). He may actually have started the symbolic view of the
taboos which he imposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the decadence comes, however, the phenomenon of rationalism
occurs on all sides in the colonial cities, older and younger alike;
and direct criticism of creed kept pace with the indirect. About 520
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> <span class="sc">Theagenes</span> of
Rhegion, in Southern Italy, had begun for the Greeks the process of
reducing the unacceptable God-stories in Homer and Hesiod&mdash;notably
the battle of the Gods in the Iliad&mdash;to mere allegories of the
cosmic elements<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9144src" href="#xd25e9144"

<p class="first">At last the critical spirit finds utterance, in the
great Periklean period, at Athens, but first by way of importation from
Ionia, where Miletos had fallen in the year 494. <span class=
"sc">Anaxagoras</span> of Klazomenai (fl. 480&ndash;450 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>; d. 428) is the first freethinker historically known
to have been legally prosecuted and condemned<a class="noteref" id=

freethought; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>and it was in the Athens of Perikles, despite
Perikles&rsquo;s protection, that the attack was made. Coming of the
Ionian line of thinkers, and himself a pupil of Anaximenes of Miletos,
he held firmly by the scientific view of the cosmos, and taught that
the sun, instead of being animated and a deity as the Athenians
believed, was &ldquo;a red-hot mass many times larger than the
Peloponnesos&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9203src" href=
"#xd25e9203" name="xd25e9203src">167</a>&mdash;and the moon a fiery (or
earthy) solid body having in it plains and mountains and

"noteref" id="xd25e9207src" href="#xd25e9207" name=
"xd25e9207src">168</a> infinite in extent and infinitely divisible.
This &ldquo;materialistic&rdquo; doctrine as to the heavenly bodies was
propounded, as Sokrates tells in his defence, in books that in his day
anyone could buy for a drachma; and Anaxagoras further taught, like
Theagenes, that the mythical personages of the poets were mere
abstractions invested with name and gender.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9216src" href="#xd25e9216" name="xd25e9216src">169</a> Withal he
was no brawler; and even in pious Athens, where he taught in peace for
many years, he might have died in peace but for his intimacy with the
most renowned of his pupils, Perikles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The question of the deity of the sun raised an
interesting sociological question. Athenians saw no blasphemy in saying
that G&ecirc; (Gaia) or D&ecirc;m&ecirc;ter was the earth: they had
always understood as much; and the earth was simply for them a Goddess;
a vast living thing containing the principle of life. They might
similarly have tolerated the description of the sun as a kind of
red-hot earth, provided that its divinity were not challenged. The
trouble lay rather in the negative than in the positive assertion,
though the latter must for many have been shocking, inasmuch as they
had never been wont to think about the sun as they did about the
earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is told of Perikles (499&ndash;429 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>)
by the pious Plutarch, himself something of a believer in portents,
that he greatly admired Anaxagoras, from whom he &ldquo;seems to have
learned to despise those superstitious fears which the common phenomena
of the heavens produce in those who, ignorant of their cause, and
knowing nothing about them, refer them all to the immediate action of
the Gods.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9237src" href="#xd25e9237"
name="xd25e9237src">170</a> And even the stately eloquence and
imperturbable bearing of the great statesman are said to have been
learned from the Ionian master, whom he followed in &ldquo;adorning his
oratory with apt illustrations from physical science.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9243src" href="#xd25e9243" name=
"xd25e9243src">171</a> The old philosopher, however, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>whom
men called &ldquo;Nous&rdquo; or Intelligence because of the part the
name played in his teaching, left his property to go to ruin in his
devotion to ideas; and it is told, with small probability, that at one
time, old and indigent, he covered his head with his robe and decided
to starve to death; till Perikles, hearing of it, hastened to beseech
him to live to give his pupil counsel.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9250src" href="#xd25e9250" name="xd25e9250src">172</a></p>
<p>At length it occurred to the statesman&rsquo;s enemies to strike at
him through his guide, philosopher, and friend. They had already
procured the banishment of another of his teachers, Damon, as &ldquo;an
intriguer and a friend of despotism&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9257src" href="#xd25e9257" name="xd25e9257src">173</a> and one of
their fanatics, Diopeithes, a priest and a violent demagogue,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9263src" href="#xd25e9263" name=
"xd25e9263src">174</a> laid the way for an attack on Anaxagoras by
obtaining the enactment of a law that &ldquo;prosecutions should be
laid against all who disbelieved in religion and held theories of their
own about things on high.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9269src"
href="#xd25e9269" name="xd25e9269src">175</a> Anaxagoras was thus open
to indictment on the score alike of his physics and of his mythology;
though, seeing that his contemporary Diogenes of Apollonia (who before
Demokritos taught &ldquo;nothing out of nothing: nothing into
nothing,&rdquo; and affirmed the sphericity of the earth) was also in
some danger of his life at Athens,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9275src"
href="#xd25e9275" name="xd25e9275src">176</a> it is probable that the
prosecution was grounded on his physicist teaching. Saved by Perikles
from the death punishment, but by one account fined five
talents,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9281src" href="#xd25e9281" name=
"xd25e9281src">177</a> he either was exiled or chose to leave the
intolerant city; and he made his home at Lampsakos, where, as the story

children should have a holiday in the month in which he died.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9287src" href="#xd25e9287" name=

"noteref" id="xd25e9290src" href="#xd25e9290" name=
"xd25e9290src">179</a></p>
<p>Philosophically, however, he counted for less than he did as an
innovating rationalist. His doctrine of <i>Nous</i> amounted in effect
to a reaffirmation of deity; and he has been not unjustly
described<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9300src" href="#xd25e9300" name=
"xd25e9300src">180</a> as the philosophic father of the dualistic deism
or theism which, whether from within or from without the Christian
system, has been the prevailing form of religious philosophy in the
modern world. It was, in fact, the only form of theistic philosophy
capable of winning any wide assent among religiously biassed minds; and
it is the more remarkable that such a theist should have been
prosecuted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>because his notion of deity was mental, and
excluded the divinization of the heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>In the memorable episode of his expulsion from Athens we have a
finger-post to the road travelled later by Greek civilization. At
Athens itself the bulk of the free population was ignorant and bigoted
enough to allow of the law being used by any fanatic or malignant
partisan against any professed rationalist; and there is no sign that
Perikles dreamt of applying the one cure for the evil&mdash;the
systematic bestowal of rationalistic instruction on all. The fatal
maxim of ancient skepticism, that religion is a necessary restraint
upon the multitude, brought it about that everywhere, in the last
resort, the unenlightened multitude became a restraint upon reason and
freethought.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9310src" href="#xd25e9310"
name="xd25e9310src">181</a> In the more aristocratically ruled colonial
cities, as we have seen, philosophic speech was comparatively free: it
was the ignorant Athenian democracy that brought religious intolerance
into Greek life, playing towards science, in form of law, the part that
the fanatics of Egypt and Palestine had played towards the worshippers
of other Gods than their own.</p>
<p>With a baseness of which the motive may be divided between the
instincts of faction and of faith, the anti-Periklean party carried
their attack yet further; and on their behalf a comic playwright,
Hermippos, brought a charge of impiety against the statesman&rsquo;s
unwedded wife, <span class="sc">Aspasia</span>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9324src" href="#xd25e9324" name="xd25e9324src">182</a> There can
be no doubt that that famous woman cordially shared the opinions and
ideals of her husband, joining as she habitually did in the philosophic
talk of his home circle. As a Milesian she was likely enough to be a
freethinker; and all that was most rational in Athens acknowledged her
culture and her charm.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9330src" href=
"#xd25e9330" name="xd25e9330src">183</a> Perikles, who had not taken
the risk of letting Anaxagoras come to trial, himself defended Aspasia
before the dikastery, his indignation breaking through his habitual
restraint in a passion of tears, which, according to the jealous
&AElig;schines,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9333src" href="#xd25e9333"
name="xd25e9333src">184</a> won an acquittal.</p>
<p>Placed as he was, Perikles could but guard his own head and heart,
leaving the evil instrument of a religious inquisition to subsist. How
far he held with Anaxagoras we can but divine.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9338src" href="#xd25e9338" name="xd25e9338src">185</a> There is
probably no truth in Plutarch&rsquo;s tale that &ldquo;whenever he
ascended <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>the tribune to speak he used first to pray to
the Gods that nothing unfitted for the occasion might fall from his
lips.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9352src" href="#xd25e9352"
name="xd25e9352src">186</a> But as a party leader he, as a matter of
course, observed the conventions; and he may have reasoned that the
prosecutions of Anaxagoras and Aspasia, like that directed against
Pheidias, stood merely for contemporary political malice, and not for
any lasting danger to mental freedom. However that might be, Athens
continued to remain the most aggressively intolerant and
tradition-mongering of Hellenic cities. So marked is this tendency
among the Athenians that for modern students Herodotos, whose history
was published in 445 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, is relatively a
rationalist in his treatment of fable,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9360src" href="#xd25e9360" name="xd25e9360src">187</a> bringing
as he did the spirit of Ionia into things traditional and religious.
But even Herodotos remains wedded to the belief in oracles or
prophecies, claiming fulfilment for those said to have been uttered by
Bakis;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9370src" href="#xd25e9370" name=
"xd25e9370src">188</a> and his small measure of spontaneous skepticism
could avail little for critical thought. To no man, apparently, did it
occur to resist the religious spirit by systematic propaganda: that,
like the principle of representative government, was to be hit upon
only in a later age.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9373src" href=
"#xd25e9373" name="xd25e9373src">189</a> Not by a purely literary
culture, relating life merely to poetry and myth, tradition and
superstition, were men to be made fit to conduct a stable society. And
the spirit of pious persecution, once generated, went from bad to
worse, crowning itself with crime, till at length the overthrow of
Athenian self-government wrought a forlorn liberty of scientific speech
at the cost of the liberty of political action which is the basis of
all sound life.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the private vogue of freethinking at Athens
in the Periklean period, it was always a popular thing to attack it.
Some years before or after the death of Perikles there came to Athens
the alien <span class="sc">Hippo</span>, the first specifically named
atheist<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9381src" href="#xd25e9381" name=
"xd25e9381src">190</a> of Greek antiquity. The dubious tradition runs
that his tomb bore the epitaph: &ldquo;This is the grave of Hippo, whom
destiny, in destroying him, has made the equal of the immortal
Gods.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9390src" href="#xd25e9390"
name="xd25e9390src">191</a> If, as seems likely, he was the Hippo of
Rhegion mentioned by Hippolytos,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9396src"
href="#xd25e9396" name="xd25e9396src">192</a> he speculated as to
physical origins in the manner of Thales, making water generate fire,
and that in turn produce the world.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9401src"
href="#xd25e9401" name="xd25e9401src">193</a> But this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>is
uncertain. Upon him the comic muse of Athens turned its attacks very
much as it did upon Socrates. The old comic poet Kratinos, a notorious
wine-bibber, produced a comedy called <i>The Panoptai</i> (the
&ldquo;all-seers&rdquo; or &ldquo;all eyes&rdquo;), in which it would
appear that the chorus were made to represent the disciples of Hippo,
and to wear a mask covered with eyes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9416src" href="#xd25e9416" name="xd25e9416src">194</a>
Drunkenness was a venial <span class="corr" id="xd25e9425" title=
"Source: vault">fault</span> in comparison with the presumption to
speculate on physics and to doubt the sacred lore of the populace. The
end of the rule of ignorance was that a theistic philosopher who
himself discouraged scientific inquiry was to pay a heavier penalty
than did the atheist Hippo.</p>

<p class="first">While Athens was gaining power and glory and beauty
without popular wisdom, the colonial city of Abdera, in Thrace, founded
by Ionians, had like others carried on the great impulse of Ionian
philosophy, and had produced in the fifth century some of the great
thinkers of the race. Concerning the greatest of these, <span class=
"sc">Demokritos</span>, and the next in importance, <span class=

probable that the second, whether older or younger, was influenced by
the first, who indeed has influenced all scientific philosophy down to
our own day. How much he learned from his master <span class=

"xd25e9451src" href="#xd25e9451" name="xd25e9451src">196</a> The

href="#xd25e9461" name="xd25e9461src">198</a> What passes for his
teaching was constructive science of cardinal importance; for it is the
first clear statement of the atomic theory; the substitution of a real
for an abstract foundation of things. Whoever were the originator of
the theory, there is no doubt as to the assimilation of the principle
by Demokritos, who thus logically continued the non-theistic line of
thought, and developed one of the most fruitful of all scientific
principles. That this idea again is a direct development from
Babylonian science is not impossible; at least there seems to be no
doubt that Demokritos had travelled far and wide,<a class="noteref" id=

minds in the whole history of thought. No Greek thinker, not Aristotle
himself, has struck so deep as he into fundamental problems; though the
absurd label of &ldquo;the laughing philosopher,&rdquo; bestowed on him
by some peculiarly unphilosophic mind, has delayed the later

<p>His atomic theory, held in conjunction with a conception of
&ldquo;mind-stuff&rdquo; similar to that of Anaxagoras, may be termed
the high-water mark of ancient scientific thought; and it is noteworthy
that somewhat earlier in the same age <span class=

conception&mdash;perhaps more clearly attained by

perish.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9502src" href="#xd25e9502" name=

by recalling the general littleness of men. But he did little to
enlighten them; and Aristotle passed on to the world a fatal
misconception of his thought by ascribing to him the notion of
automatism where he was asserting a &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; in terms of
laws which he avowedly could not explain.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9535src" href="#xd25e9535" name="xd25e9535src">210</a> Against
such misconception he should have provided. Demokritos, however,
shunned dialectic and discussion, and founded no school;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9544src" href="#xd25e9544" name=
"xd25e9544src">211</a> and although his atomism was later adopted by
Epicurus, it was no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"
name="pb159">159</a>]</span>more developed on a basis of investigation
and experiment than was the biology of Empedokles. His ethic, though
wholly rationalistic, leant rather to quietism and resignation than to
reconstruction,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9549src" href="#xd25e9549"
name="xd25e9549src">212</a> and found its application only in the later
static message of Epicurus. Greek society failed to set up the
conditions needed for progress beyond the point gained by its unguided
forces.</p>
<p>Thus when Protagoras ventured to read, at the house of the
freethinking Euripides, a treatise of his own, beginning with the
avowal that he offered no opinion as to the existence of the Gods, life
being too short for the inquiry,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9554src"
href="#xd25e9554" name="xd25e9554src">213</a> the remark got wind, and
he had to fly for his life, though Euripides and perhaps most of the
guests were very much of the same way of thinking.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e9560src" href="#xd25e9560" name="xd25e9560src">214</a> In the
course of his flight, the tradition goes, the philosopher was
drowned;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9563src" href="#xd25e9563" name=
"xd25e9563src">215</a> and his book was publicly burned, all who

his case as in that of Anaxagoras; for the philosophic doctrine of
Protagoras became common enough. It is not impossible, though the date
is doubtful, that the attack on him was one of the results of the great
excitement in Athens in the year 415 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> over
the sacrilegious mutilation of the figures of Hermes, the familial or
boundary-God, in the streets by night. It was about that time that the
poet <span class="sc">Diagoras</span> of Melos was proscribed for
atheism, he having declared that the non-punishment of a certain act of
iniquity proved that there were no Gods.<a class="noteref" id=

antidote to the bane of fanaticism was found or sought; and the most
famous publicist in Athens was the next victim.</p>
<p>The fatality of the Athenian development is seen not only in the
direct hostility of the people to rational thought, but in their loss
of their hold even on their public polity. For lack of political
judgment, moved always by the passions which their literary culture
cherished, they so mishandled their affairs in the long and
demoralizing Peloponnesian war that they were at one time cowed by
their own aristocracy, on essentially absurd pretexts, into abandoning
the democratic constitution. Its restoration was followed at the final
crisis by another tyranny, also short-lived, but abnormally bloody and
iniquitous; and though the people at its overthrow showed a moderation
in remarkable contrast to the cruelty and rapacity of the aristocrats,
the effect of such extreme vicissitude was to increase the total
disposition towards civic violence and coercion. And while the people
menaced freethinking in religion, the aristocracies opposed
freethinking in politics. Thus under the Thirty Tyrants all
intellectual teaching was forbidden; and Kritias, himself accused of
having helped Alkibiades to parody the mysteries, sharply interdicted
the political rationalism of Sokrates,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9641src" href="#xd25e9641" name="xd25e9641src">224</a> who
according to tradition had been one of his own instructors.</p>
<p>It was a result of the general movement of mind throughout the rest
of the Hellenic world that freethinkers of culture were still numerous.
<span class="sc">Archelaos</span> of Miletos, the most important
disciple of Anaxagoras; according to a late tradition, the master of
Sokrates; and the first systematic teacher of Ionic physical science in
Athens, taught the infinity of the universe, grasped the explanation of
the nature of sound, and set forth on purely rationalistic lines the
social origin and basis of morals, thus giving Sokrates his practical
lead.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9655src" href="#xd25e9655" name=

<span class="sc">Metrodoros</span> of Lampsakos (not to be confounded
with Metrodoros of Chios, and the other Metrodoros of Lampsakos who was
the friend of Epicurus, both also freethinkers), carried out zealously
his master&rsquo;s teaching as to the deities and heroes of Homer,
resolving them into mere elemental combinations and physical agencies,
and making Zeus stand for mind, and Athen&ecirc; for art.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9669src" href="#xd25e9669" name=
"xd25e9669src">226</a> And in the <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i> of
Athens itself, in the dramas of <span class="sc">Euripides</span>
[480&ndash;406 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>], who is said to have been
the ardent disciple of Anaxagoras,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9697src"
href="#xd25e9697" name="xd25e9697src">227</a> to have studied

name="xd25e9703src">228</a> and to have been the friend of Sokrates and
Protagoras, there emerge traces enough of a rationalism not to be
reconciled with the old belief in the Gods. If Euripides has nowhere
ventured on such a terrific paradox as the <i>Prometheus</i>, he has in
a score of passages revealed a stress of skepticism which, inasmuch as
he too uses all the forms of Hellenic faith,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9710src" href="#xd25e9710" name="xd25e9710src">229</a> deepens
our doubt as to the beliefs of &AElig;schylus. Euripides even gave
overt proof of his unbelief, beginning his <i>Melanippe</i> with the
line: &ldquo;Zeus, whoever Zeus be, for I know not, save by
report,&rdquo; an audacity which evoked a great uproar. In a later
production the passage was prudently altered;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9719src" href="#xd25e9719" name="xd25e9719src">230</a> but he
never put much check on his native tendency to analyse and criticize on
all issues&mdash;a tendency fostered, as we have seen,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9725src" href="#xd25e9725" name=
"xd25e9725src">231</a> by the constant example of real and poignant
dialectic in the Athenian dikastery, and the whole drift of the
Athenian stage. In his case the tendency even overbalances the artistic
process;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9728src" href="#xd25e9728" name=
"xd25e9728src">232</a> but it has the advantage of involving a very
bold handling of vital problems. Not satisfied with a merely dramatic
presentment of lawless Gods, Euripides makes his characters impeach
them as such,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9737src" href="#xd25e9737"
name="xd25e9737src">233</a> or, again, declare that there can be no

them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9757src" href="#xd25e9757" name=

of the educated Greeks.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9826src" href=
"#xd25e9826" name="xd25e9826src">240</a></p>
<p>Here again, as in the case of &AElig;schylus, there arises the
problem of contradiction; for Euripides, too, puts often in the mouths
of his characters emphatic expressions of customary piety. The
conclusion in the two cases must be broadly the same&mdash;that whereas
an unbelieving dramatist may well make his characters talk in the
ordinary way of deity and of religion, it is unintelligible that a
believing one should either go beyond the artistic bounds of his task
to make them utter an unbelief which must have struck the average
listener as strange and noxious, or construct a drama of which the
whole effect is to insist on the odiousness of the action of the
Supreme God. And the real drift of Euripides is so plain that one
modern and Christian scholar has denounced him as an obnoxious and
unbelieving sophist who abused his opportunity as a producer of dramas
under religious auspices to &ldquo;shake the ground-works of
religion&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9836src" href="#xd25e9836"
name="xd25e9836src">241</a> and at the same time of morals;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9842src" href="#xd25e9842" name=
"xd25e9842src">242</a> while another and a greater scholar, less
vehement in his orthodoxy, more restrainedly condemns the dramatist for
employing myths in which he did not believe, instead of inventing fresh
plots.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9848src" href="#xd25e9848" name=
"xd25e9848src">243</a> Christian scholars are thus duly unready to give
him credit for his many-sided humanity, nobly illustrated in his pleas

"noteref" id="xd25e9860src" href="#xd25e9860" name=
"xd25e9860src">244</a> Latterly the recognition of Euripides&rsquo;s
freethinking has led to the description of him as &ldquo;Euripides the
Rationalist,&rdquo; in a treatise which represents him as a systematic
assailant of the religion of his day. Abating somewhat of that thesis,
which imputes more of system to the Euripidean <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>drama than it possesses, we may sum up that the
last of the great tragedians of Athens, and the most human and lovable
of the three, was assuredly a rationalist in matters of religion. It is
noteworthy that he used more frequently than any other ancient
dramatist the device of a <i lang="la">deus ex machina</i> to end a
play.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9872src" href="#xd25e9872" name=
"xd25e9872src">245</a> It was probably because for him the conception
had no serious significance.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9878src" href=

figures as a brawling bully. Only the thinkers of the time could
realize the thought that underlay such a tragi-comedy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Dr. Verrall&rsquo;s <i>Euripides the Rationalist</i>,
1897, is fairly summed up by Mr. Haigh (<i>Tragic Drama of the
Greeks</i>, pp. 262, 265, <i>notes</i>): &ldquo;He considers that
Euripides was a skeptic of the aggressive type, whose principal object
in writing tragedy was to attack the State religion, but who,
perceiving that it would be dangerous to pose as an open enemy,
endeavoured to accomplish his ends by covert ridicule&#8202;&hellip;.
His plays &hellip; contain in reality two separate plots&mdash;the
ostensible and superficial plot, which was intended to satisfy the
orthodox, and the rationalized modification which lay half concealed
beneath it, and which the intelligent skeptic would easily
detect.&rdquo; For objections to this thesis see Haigh, as cited;
Jevons, <i>Hist. of Greek Lit.</i> p. 222, <i>note</i>; and Dr.
Mozley&rsquo;s article in the <i>Classical Review</i>, Nov. 1895, pp.
407&ndash;13. As to the rationalism of Euripides in general see many of
the passages cited by Bishop Westcott in his <i>Essays in the Hist. of
Relig. Thought in the West</i>, 1891, pp. 102&ndash;27. And cp.
Dickinson, <i>The Greek View of Life</i>, pp. 46&ndash;49; Grote,
<i>Hist</i>. i, 346&ndash;48; Zeller, <i>Socrates and the Socratic
Schools</i>, Eng. tr. 3rd ed. p. 231; Murray, <i>Anc. Greek Lit.</i>
pp. 256, 264&ndash;66.</p>
<p>Over the latest play of Euripides, the <i>Bacch&aelig;</i>, as over
one of the last plays of &AElig;schylus, the <i>Prometheus</i>, there
has been special debate. It was probably written in Macedonia (cp.
ll<span class="corr" id="xd25e9932" title="Not in source">.</span>,
408, 565), whither the poet had gone on the invitation of King
Archelaos, when, according to the ancient sketch of his life, &ldquo;he
had to leave Athens because of the malicious exultation over him of
nearly all the city.&rdquo; The trouble, it is conjectured, &ldquo;may
have been something connected with his prosecution for impiety, the
charge on which Socrates was put to death a few years after&rdquo;
(Murray, <i>Euripides translated into English Rhyming Verse</i>, 1902,
introd. essay, p. lii). Inasmuch as the play glorifies Dionysos, and
the &ldquo;atheist&rdquo; Pentheus (l. 995) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>who
resists him is slain by the maddened Bacchantes, led by his own mother,
it is seriously argued that the drama &ldquo;may be regarded as in some
sort an <i>apologia</i> and an <i>eirenicon</i>, or as a confession on
the part of the poet that he was fully conscious that in some of the
simple legends of the popular faith there was an element of sound sense
(!) which thoughtful men must treat with forbearance, resolved on using
it, if possible, as an instrument for inculcating a truer morality,
instead of assailing it with a presumptuous denial&rdquo; (J. E.
Sandys, <i>The Bacch&aelig; of Euripides</i>, 1880, introd. pp.
lxxv&ndash;vi). Here we have the conformist ethic of the average
English academic brought to bear on, and ascribed to, the personality
of the Greek dramatist.</p>
<p>An academic of the same order, Prof. Mahaffy, similarly suggests
that &ldquo;among the half-educated Macedonian youth, with whom
literature was coming into fashion, the poet <i>may</i> have met with a
good deal of that insolent second-hand skepticism which is so offensive
to a deep and serious thinker, and he <i>may</i> have wished to show
them that he was not, as they <i>doubtless</i> hailed him, the apostle
of this random speculative arrogance&rdquo; (<i>Euripides</i> in Class.
Writ. Ser. 1879, p. 85). As against the eminently &ldquo;random&rdquo;
and &ldquo;speculative arrogance&rdquo; of this particular
passage&mdash;a characteristic product of the obscurantist functions of
some British university professors in matters of religion, and one
which may fitly be pronounced offensive to honest men&mdash;it may be
suggested on the other hand that, if Euripides got into trouble in
Athens by his skepticism, he would be likely in Macedonia to encounter
rather a greater stress of bigotry than a freethinking welcome, and
that a non-critical presentment of the savage religious legend was
forced on him by his environment.</p>
<p>Much of the academic discussion on the subject betrays a singular
slowness to accept the dramatic standpoint. Even Prof. Murray, the
finest interpreter of Euripides, dogmatically pronounces (introd. cited
p. lvii) that &ldquo;there is in the <i>Bacch&aelig;</i> <i>real and
heartfelt</i> glorification of Dionysus,&rdquo; simply because of the
lyrical exaltation of the Bacchic choruses. But lyrical exaltation was
in character here above all other cases; and it was the
dramatist&rsquo;s business to present it. To say that &ldquo;again and
again in the lyrics you feel that the M&aelig;nads are no longer merely
observed and analysed: the poet has entered into them and they into
him,&rdquo; is nothing to the purpose. That the words which fall from
the Chorus or its Leader are at times &ldquo;not the words of a raving
Bacchante, but of a gentle and deeply musing philosopher,&rdquo; is
still nothing to the purpose. The same could be said of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s handling of Macbeth. What, in sooth, would the real
words of a raving Bacchante be like? If Milton lent dignity to Satan in
Puritan England, was Euripides to do <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>less for Dionysos in
Macedonia? That he should make Pentheus unsympathetic belongs to the
plot. If he had made a noble martyr of the victim as well as an
impassive destroyer of the God, he might have had to leave Macedonia
more precipitately than he left Athens.</p>
<p>Prof. Murray recognizes all the while that &ldquo;Euripides never
palliates things. He leaves this savage story as savage as he found
it&rdquo;; that he presents a &ldquo;triumphant and <i>hateful</i>
Dionysus,&rdquo; who gives &ldquo;a helpless fatalistic answer,
abandoning the moral standpoint,&rdquo; when challenged by the stricken
Agav&ecirc;, whom the God has moved to dismember her own son; and that,
in short, &ldquo;Euripides is, as usual, critical or even hostile to
the myth that he celebrates&rdquo; (as cited, pp. liv-lvi). To set
against these solid facts, as does Mr. Sandys (as cited, pp.
lxxiii-iv), some passages in the choruses (ll. 395, 388, 427, 1002),
and in a speech of Dionysos (1002), enouncing normal platitudes about
the wisdom of thinking like other people and living a quiet life, is to
strain very uncritically the elastic dramatic material. So far from
being &ldquo;not entirely in keeping&rdquo; with the likely sentiments
of a chorus of Asiatic women, the first-cited passages&mdash;telling
that cleverness is not wisdom, and that true wisdom acquiesces in the
opinions of ordinary people&mdash;are just the kind of mock-modest
ineptitudes always current among the complacent ignorant; and the sage
language ascribed to the heartless God is simply a presentment of deity
in the fashion in which all Greeks expected to have it presented.</p>
<p>The fact remains that the story of the <i>Bacch&aelig;</i>, in which
the frenzied mother helps to tear to pieces her own son, and the God
can but say it is all fated, is as revolting to the rational moral
sense as the story of the <i>Prometheus</i>. If this be an
<i>eirenicon</i>, it is surely the most ironical in literary history.
To see in the impassive delineation of such a myth an acceptance by the
poet of popular &ldquo;sound sense,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a desire to put
himself right with the public in matters on which he had been
misunderstood,&rdquo; seems possible only to academics trained to a
particular handling of the popular creed of their own day. This view,
first put forward by Tyrwhitt (<i lang="la">Conjectur&aelig; in
&AElig;schylum, etc.</i> 1822), was adopted by Schoone (p. 20 of his
ed. cited by Sandys). Lobeck, greatly daring wherever rationalism was
concerned, suggested that Euripides actually wrote against the
rationalists of his time, in commendation of the Bacchic cult, and to
justify the popular view in religious matters as against that of the
cultured (<i>Aglaophamus</i>&mdash;passages quoted by Sandys, p.
lxxvi). Musgrave, following Tyrwhitt, makes the play out to be an
attack on Kritias, Alkibiades, and other freethinkers, including even
Sokrates! K. O. M&uuml;ller, always ineptly conventional in such
matters, finds Euripides in this play &ldquo;converted into a positive
believer, or, in other words, convinced that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>religion should not be exposed to the subtilties
of reasoning; that the understanding of man cannot subvert ancestral
traditions which are as old as time,&rdquo; and so on; and in the
Polonius-platitudes of Tiresias and the worldly-wise counsels of Cadmus
he finds &ldquo;great impressiveness&rdquo; (<i>Hist. Lit. Anc.
Greece</i>, p. 379).</p>
<p>The bulk of the literature of the subject, in short, suggests sombre
reflections on the moral value of much academic thinking. There are,
however, academic suffrages on the side of common sense. Mr. Haigh
(<i>Tragic Drama of the Greeks</i>, pp. 313&ndash;14) gently dismisses
the &ldquo;recantation&rdquo; theory; Hartung points out (<i lang=
"la">Euripides restitutus</i>, 1844, ii, 542, cited by Sandys) that
Euripides really treats the legend of Pentheus very much as he treats
the myth of Hippolytos thirty years earlier, showing no change of moral
attitude. E. Pfander (cited by Sandys) took a similar view; as did Mr.
Tyrrell in his edition of the play (1871), though the latter persisted
in taking the commonplaces of the chorus about true wisdom (395) for
the judgments of the dramatist. Euripides could hardly have been called
&ldquo;the philosopher of the stage&rdquo; (Athen&aelig;us, iv, 48) on
the strength of sentiments which are common to the village wiseacres of
all ages. The critical method which ascribes to Euripides a final
hostility to rationalism would impute to Shakespeare the religion of
Isabella in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, when the talk of the Duke as a
friar counselling a condemned man is wholly &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; or
unbelieving.</p>
<p>In his admirable little book, <i>Euripides and his Age</i> (1913),
Prof. Murray repeats his account of the <i>Bacch&aelig;</i> with some
additions and modifications. He adheres to the &ldquo;heartfelt
glorification of Dionysus,&rdquo; but adds (p. 188): &ldquo;No doubt it
is Dionysus in some private sense of the poet&rsquo;s own &hellip; some
spirit of &hellip; inspiration and untrammelled life. The presentation
is not consistent, however magical the poetry.&rdquo; As to the theory
that &ldquo;the veteran free-lance of thought &hellip; now saw the
error of his ways and was returning to orthodoxy,&rdquo; he pronounces
that &ldquo;Such a view strikes us now as almost childish in its
incompetence&rdquo; (p. 190). He also reminds us that &ldquo;the whole
scheme of the play is given by the ancient ritual&#8202;&hellip;. All
kinds of small details which seemed like &hellip; rather fantastic
invention on the part of Euripides are taken straight from
&AElig;schylus or the ritual, or both&#8202;&hellip;. The
<i>Bacch&aelig;</i> is not free invention; it is tradition&rdquo; (pp.
182&ndash;84). And in sum: &ldquo;It is well to remember that, for all
his lucidity of language, Euripides is not lucid about religion&rdquo;
(p. 190).</p>
<p>In conclusion we may ask, How could he be? He wrote plays for the
Greek stage, which had its very roots in religious tradition, and was
run for the edification of a crudely believing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>populace. It is much that in so doing Euripides
could a hundred times challenge the evil religious ethic given him for
his subject-matter; and his lasting vogue in antiquity showed that he
had a hold on the higher Greek conscience which no other dramatist ever
possessed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But while Euripides must thus have made a special appeal to the
reflecting minority even in his own day, it is clear that he was not at
first popular with the many; and his efforts, whatever he may have
hoped to achieve, could not suffice to enlighten the democracy. The
ribald blasphemies of his enemy, the believing Aristophanes,<a class=

"xd25e10031src">247</a> could avail more to keep vulgar religion in
credit than the tragedian&rsquo;s serious indictment could effect
against it; and they served at the same time to belittle Euripides for
the multitude in his own day. Aristophanes is the typical Tory in
religion; non-religious himself, like Swift, he hates the honestly
anti-religious man; and he has the crowd with him. The Athenian faith,
as a Catholic scholar remarks,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10040src"
href="#xd25e10040" name="xd25e10040src">248</a> &ldquo;was more
disposed to suffer the buffooneries of a comedian than the serious
negation of a philosopher.&rdquo; The average Greek seemed to think
that the grossest comic impiety did no harm, where serious negation
might cause divine wrath.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10046src" href=
"#xd25e10046" name="xd25e10046src">249</a> And so there came no
intellectual salvation for Athens from the drama which was her unique
achievement. The balance of ignorance and culture was not changed.
Evidently there was much rationalism among the studious few. Plato in
the <i>Laws</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e10057src" href="#xd25e10057"
name="xd25e10057src">250</a> speaks both of the man-about-town type of
freethinker and of those who, while they believe in no Gods, live well
and wisely and are in good repute. But with Plato playing the superior
mind and encouraging his fellow-townsmen to believe in the personality
of the sun, moon, and planets, credulity could easily keep the upper
hand.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10062src" href="#xd25e10062" name=
"xd25e10062src">251</a> The people remained politically unwise and
religiously superstitious, the social struggle perpetuating the
division between leisure and toil, even apart from the life of the mass
of slaves; while the eternal pre-occupation of militarism left even the
majority of the upper class at the intellectual level natural to
military life in all ages. There came, however, a generation of great
intellectual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>splendour following on that of the supreme
development of drama just before the fall of Greek freedom. Athens had
at last come into the heritage of Greek philosophic thought; and to the
utterance of that crowning generation the human retrospect has turned
ever since. This much of renown remains inalienable from the most
renowned democracy of the ancient world.</p>

<p class="first">The wide subject of the teaching of <span class=
"sc">Sokrates</span>, <span class="sc">Plato</span>, and <span class=
"sc">Aristotle</span> must here be noticed briefly, with a view only to
our special inquiry. All three must be inscribed in any list of ancient
freethinkers; and yet all three furthered freethought only indirectly,
the two former being in different degrees supernaturalists, while the
last touched on religious questions only as a philosopher, avoiding all
question of practical innovation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The same account holds good of the best of the
so-called Sophists, as <span class="sc">Gorgias</span> the Sicilian (?
485&ndash;380), who was a nihilistic skeptic; <span class=
"sc">Hippias</span> of Elis, who, setting up an emphatic distinction
between Nature and Convention, impugned the political laws and
prejudices which estranged men of thought and culture; and <span class=
"sc">Prodikos</span> of Kos (fl. 435), author of the fable of Herakles
at the Parting of the Ways, who seems to have privately criticized the
current Gods as mere deifications of useful things and forces, and was
later misconceived as teaching that the things and forces were Gods.
Cp. Cicero, <i lang="la">De nat. Deorum</i>, i, 42; Sextus Empiricus,
<i lang="la">Adv. Mathematicos</i>, ix, 52; Ueberweg, vol. i, p. 78;
Renouvier, i, 291&ndash;93. Cicero saw very well that if men came to
see in D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r merely a deification of corn or bread,
in Dionysos wine, in Hephaistos fire, and in Poseidon only water, there
was not much left in religion. On the score of their systematic
skepticism, that is, their insistence on the subjectivity of all
opinion, Prof. Drews pronounces the Sophists at once the
&ldquo;<span lang="de">Aufkl&auml;rer</span>&rdquo; and the Pragmatists
of ancient Greece (<i lang="de">Gesch. des Monismus</i>, p. 209). But
their thought was scarcely homogeneous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Sokrates</span> [468&ndash;399] was
fundamentally and practically a freethinker, insofar as in most things
he thought for himself, definitely turning away from the old ideal of
mere transmitted authority in morals.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10117src" href="#xd25e10117" name="xd25e10117src">252</a>
Starting in all inquiries from a position of professed ignorance, he at
least repudiated all dogmatics.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10126src"
href="#xd25e10126" name="xd25e10126src">253</a> Being, however,
preoccupied with public life and conduct, he did not carry <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>his
critical thinking far beyond that sphere. In regard to the extension of
solid science, one of the prime necessities of Greek intellectual life,
he was quite reactionary, drawing a line between the phenomena which he
thought intelligible and traceable and those which he thought past
finding out. &ldquo;Physics and astronomy, in his opinion, belonged to
the divine class of phenomena in which human research was insane,
fruitless, and impious.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10139src"
href="#xd25e10139" name="xd25e10139src">254</a> Yet at the same time he
formulated, apparently of his own motion, the ordinary design
argument.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10149src" href="#xd25e10149" name=
"xd25e10149src">255</a> The sound scientific view led up to by so many
previous thinkers was set forth, even in religious phraseology, by his
great contemporary Hippokrates,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10155src"
href="#xd25e10155" name="xd25e10155src">256</a> and he opposed it.
While partially separating himself in practice from the popular
worships, he held by the belief in omens, though not in all the
ordinary ones; and in one of the Platonic dialogues he is made to say
he holds by the ordinary versions of all the myths, on the ground that
it is a hopeless task to find rational explanations for them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10161src" href="#xd25e10161" name=
"xd25e10161src">257</a> He hoped, in short, to rationalize conduct
without seeking to rationalize creed&mdash;the dream of Plato and of a
thousand religionists since.</p>
<p>He had indeed the excuse that the myth-rationalizers of the time
after Hekataios, following the line of least psychic resistance, like
those of England and Germany in the eighteenth century, explained away
myths by reducing them to hypothetical history, thus asking credence
for something no better verified than the myth itself. But the
rationalizers were on a path by which men might conceivably have
journeyed to a truer science; and Sokrates, by refusing to undertake
any such exploration,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10172src" href=
"#xd25e10172" name="xd25e10172src">258</a> left his countrymen to that
darkening belief in tradition which made possible his own execution.
There was in his cast of mind, indeed&mdash;if we can at all accept
Plato&rsquo;s presentment of him&mdash;something unfavourable to steady
conviction. He cannot have had any real faith in the current religion;
yet he never explicitly dissented. In the <i>Republic</i> he accepts
the new festival to the Thracian Goddess Bendis; and there he is made
by Plato to inculcate a quite orthodox acceptance of the Delphic oracle
as the source of all religious practice. But it is impossible to say
how much of the teaching of the Platonic Sokrates is Sokratic. And as
to Plato there remains the problem of how far <i>his</i> conformities
were prudential, after the execution of Sokrates for blasphemy.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The long-debated issue as to the real personality of
Sokrates is still open. It is energetically and systematically handled
by Prof. August D&ouml;ring in <i lang="de">Die Lehre des Sokrates als
sociales Reformsystem</i> (1895), and by Dr. Hubert R&ouml;ck in
<i lang="de">Der unverf&auml;lschte Sokrates</i> (1903). See, in
particular, D&ouml;ring, pp. 51&ndash;79, and R&ouml;ck, pp.
357&ndash;96. From all attempts to arrive at a conception of a
consistent Sokrates there emerges the impression that the real
Sokrates, despite a strong critical bent of mind, had no clearly
established body of opinions, but was swayed in different directions by
the itch for contradiction which was the driving power of his
dialectic. For the so-called Sokratic &ldquo;method&rdquo; is much less
a method for attaining truth than one for disturbing prejudice. And if
in Plato&rsquo;s hands Sokrates seldom reaches a conclusion that his
own method might not overthrow, we are not entitled to refuse to
believe that this was characteristic of the man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning Sokrates we have Xenophon&rsquo;s circumstantial
account<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10197src" href="#xd25e10197" name=
"xd25e10197src">259</a> of how he reasoned with Aristodemos,
&ldquo;surnamed the Little,&rdquo; who &ldquo;neither prayed nor
sacrificed to the Gods, nor consulted any oracle, and ridiculed those
who did.&rdquo; Aristodemos was a theist, believing in a &ldquo;Great
Architect&rdquo; or &ldquo;Artist,&rdquo; or a number of such
powers&mdash;on this he is as vague as the ancient theists in
general&mdash;but does not think the heavenly powers need his
devotions. Sokrates, equally vague as to the unity or plurality of the
divine, puts the design argument in the manner familiar throughout the
ages,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10202src" href="#xd25e10202" name=
"xd25e10202src">260</a> and follows it up with the plea, among others,
that the States most renowned for wisdom and antiquity have always been
the most given to pious practices, and that probably the Gods will be
kind to those who show them respect. The whole philosopheme is pure
empiricism, on the ordinary plane of polytheistic thought, and may
almost be said to exhibit incapacity for the handling of philosophic
questions, evading as it does even the elementary challenge of
Aristodemos, against whom Sokrates parades pious platitudes without a
hint of &ldquo;Sokratic&rdquo; analysis. Unless such a performance were
regarded as make-believe, it is difficult to conceive how Athenian
pietists could honestly arraign Sokrates for irreligion while
Aristodemos and others of his way of thinking went unmolested.</p>
<p>Taken as illustrating the state of thought in the Athenian
community, the trial and execution of Sokrates for
&ldquo;blasphemy&rdquo; and &ldquo;corrupting the minds of the
young&rdquo; go far to prove that there <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>prevailed among the
upper class in Athens nearly as much hypocrisy in religious matters as
exists in the England of to-day. Doubtless he was liable to death from
the traditionally orthodox Greek point of view,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10212src" href="#xd25e10212" name="xd25e10212src">261</a> having
practically turned aside from the old civic creed and ideals; but then
most educated Athenians had in some degree done the same.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10224src" href="#xd25e10224" name=
"xd25e10224src">262</a> Euripides, as we have seen, is so frequently
critical of the old theology and mythology in his plays that he too
could easily have been indicted; and Aristophanes, who attacked
Euripides in his comedies as scurrilously as he did Sokrates, would no
doubt have been glad to see him prosecuted.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10230src" href="#xd25e10230" name="xd25e10230src">263</a> The
psychology of Aristophanes, who freely ridiculed and blasphemed the
Gods in his own comedies while reviling all men who did not believe in
them, is hardly intelligible save in the light of parts of the English
history of our own time, when unbelieving indifferentists on the
Conservative side have been seen ready to join in turning the law
against a freethinking publicist for purely party ends. In the case of
Sokrates the hostility was ostensibly democratic, for, according to
&AElig;schines, Sokrates was condemned because he had once given
lessons to Kritias,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10236src" href=
"#xd25e10236" name="xd25e10236src">264</a> one of the most savage and
unscrupulous of the Thirty Tyrants. Inasmuch as Kritias had become
entirely alienated from Sokrates, and had even put him to silence, such
a ground of hostility would only be a fresh illustration of that
collective predilection of men to a gregarious iniquity which is no
less noteworthy in the psychology of groups than their profession of
high moral standards. And such proclivities are always to be reckoned
with in such episodes. Anytos, the leading prosecutor, seems to have
been a typical bigot, brainless, spiteful, and thoroughly
self-satisfied. Not only party malice, however, but the individual
dislikes which Sokrates so industriously set up,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10246src" href="#xd25e10246" name="xd25e10246src">265</a> must
have counted for much in securing the small majority of the dikastery
that pronounced him guilty&mdash;281 to 276; and his own clear
preference for death over any sort of compromise did the rest.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10264src" href="#xd25e10264" name=
"xd25e10264src">266</a> He was old, and little <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>hopeful of social betterment; and the
temperamental obstinacy which underlay his perpetual and pertinacious
debating helped him to choose a death that he could easily have
avoided. But the fact remains that he was not popular; that the mass of
the voters as well as of the upper class disliked his constant
cross-examination of popular opinion,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10269src" href="#xd25e10269" name="xd25e10269src">267</a> which
must often have led logical listeners to carry on criticism where he
left off; and that after all his ratiocination he left Athens
substantially irrational, as well as incapable of justice, on some
essential issues. His dialectic method has done more to educate the
later world than it did for Greece.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Upon the debate as to the legal punishability of
Sokrates turns another as to the moral character of the Athenians who
forced him to drink the hemlock. Professor Mahaffy, bent on proving the
superiority of Athenian culture and civilization to those of
Christendom, effectively contrasts the calm scene in the prison-chamber
of Sokrates with the hideous atrocities of the death penalty for
treason in the modern world and the &ldquo;gauntness and horror of our
modern executions&rdquo; (<i>Social Life in Greece</i>, 3rd. ed. pp.
262&ndash;69); and Mr. Bleeckly (<i>Socrates and the Athenians</i>,
1884, pp. 55&ndash;63) similarly sets against the pagan case that of
the burning of heretics by the Christian Church, and in particular the
<i>auto da f&eacute;</i> at Valladolid in 1559, when fifteen men and
women&mdash;the former including the conscientious priests who had
proposed to meet the hostility of Protestant dissent in the Netherlands
by reforms in the Church: the latter including delicately-nurtured
ladies of high family&mdash;were burned to death before the eyes of the
Princess Regent of Spain and the aristocracy of Castile. It is
certainly true that this transaction has no parallel in the criminal
proceedings of pagan Athens. Christian cruelty has been as much viler
than pagan, culture for culture, as the modern Christian environment is
uglier than the Athenian. Before such a test the special pleaders for
the civilizing power of Christianity can but fall back upon alternative
theses which are the negation of their main case. First we are told
that &ldquo;Christianity humanizes men&rdquo;; next that where it does
<i>not</i> do so it is because they are too inhuman to be made
Christians.</p>
<p>But while the orthodoxy of pagan Athens thus comes very well off as
against the frightful crime-roll of organized Christianity, the
dispassionate historian must nonetheless note the dehumanizing power of
religion in Athens as in Christendom. The pietists of Athens, in their
less brutish way, were as hopelessly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>denaturalized as
those of Christian Europe by the dominion of a traditional creed, held
as above reason. It matters not whether or not we say with Bishop
Thirlwall (<i>Hist. of Greece</i>, 2nd ed. iv, 556) that &ldquo;there
never was a case in which murder was more clearly committed under the
forms of legal procedure than in the trial of Socrates,&rdquo; or press
on the other side the same writer&rsquo;s admission that in religious
matters in Athens &ldquo;there was no canon, no book by which a
doctrine could be tried; no living authority to which appeal could be
made for the decision of religious controversies.&rdquo; The fact that
Christendom had &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; who ruled which of two sets
of insane dogmas brought death upon its propounder, does not make less
abominable the slaying of Bruno and Servetus, or the immeasurable
massacre of less eminent heretics. But the less formalized homicides
sanctioned by the piety of Periklean Athens remain part of the proof
that unreasoning faith worsens men past calculation. If we slur over
such deeds by generalities about human frailty, we are but asserting
the impossibility of rationally respecting human nature. If, putting
aside all moral censure, we are simply concerned to trace and
comprehend causation in human affairs, we have no choice but to note
how upon occasion religion on one hand, like strong drink on another,
can turn commonplace men into murderers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In view of the limitations of Sokrates, and the mental measure of
those who voted for putting him to death, it is not surprising that
through all Greek history educated men (including Aristotle) continued
to believe firmly in the deluge of Deukalion<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10300src" href="#xd25e10300" name="xd25e10300src">268</a> and the
invasion of the Amazons<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10306src" href=
"#xd25e10306" name="xd25e10306src">269</a> as solid historical facts.
Such beliefs, of course, are on all fours with those current in the
modern religious world down till the present century: we shall, in
fact, best appraise the rationality of Greece by making such
comparisons. The residual lesson is that where Greek reason ended,
modern social science had better be regarded as only beginning.
<span class="sc">Thukydides</span>, the greatest of all the ancient
historians, and one of the great of all time, treated human affairs in
a spirit so strictly rationalistic that he might reasonably be termed
an atheist on that score even if he had not earned the name as a pupil
of Anaxagoras.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10317src" href="#xd25e10317"
name="xd25e10317src">270</a> But his task was to chronicle a war which
proved that the Greeks were to the last children of instinct for the
main purposes of life, and that the rule of reason which they are
credited with establishing<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10323src" href=
"#xd25e10323" name="xd25e10323src">271</a> was only an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>intermittent pastime. In the days of Demosthenes
we still find them politically consulting the Pythian oracle, despite
the consciousness among educated men that the oracle is a piece of
political machinery. We can best realize the stage of their evolution
by first comparing their public religious practice with that of
contemporary England. No one now regards the daily prayers of the House
of Commons as more than a reverent formality. But Nikias at Syracuse
staked the fortunes of war on the creed of omens. We can perhaps
finally conceive with fair accuracy the subordination of Greek culture
and politics to superstition by likening the thought-levels of
pre-Alexandrian Athens to those of England under Cromwell.</p>
<p>2. The decisive measure of Greek accomplishment is found in the
career of <span class="sc">Plato</span> [429&ndash;347]. One of the
great prose writers of the world, he has won by his literary
genius&mdash;that is, by his power of continuous presentation as well
as by his style&mdash;no less than by his service to supernaturalist
philosophy in general, a repute above his deserts as a thinker. In
Christian history he is the typical philosopher of Dualism,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10334src" href="#xd25e10334" name=
"xd25e10334src">272</a> his prevailing conception of the universe being
that of an inert Matter acted on or even created by a craftsman-God,
the &ldquo;Divine Artificer,&rdquo; sometimes conceived as a
<i>Logos</i> or divine Reason, separately personalized. Thus he came to
be <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> the philosopher of theism, as
against Aristotle and those of the Pythagoreans who affirmed the
eternity of the universe.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10346src" href=
"#xd25e10346" name="xd25e10346src">273</a> In the history of
freethought he figures as a man of genius formed by Sokrates and
reflecting his limitations, developing the Sokratic dialectic on the
one hand and finally emphasizing the Sokratic dogmatism to the point of
utter bigotry. If the Athenians are to be condemned for putting
Sokrates to death, it must not be forgotten that the spirit, if not the
letter, of the <i>Laws</i> drawn up by Plato in his old age fully
justified them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10359src" href="#xd25e10359"
name="xd25e10359src">274</a> That code, could it ever have been put in
force, would have wrought the death of every honest freethinker as well
as most of the ignorant believers within its sphere. Alone among the
great serious writers of Greece does he implicate Greek thought in the
gospel of intolerance passed on to modern Europe from antiquity. It is
recorded of him<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10368src" href="#xd25e10368"
name="xd25e10368src">275</a> that he wished to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>burn
all the writings of Demokritos that he could collect, and was dissuaded
only on the score of the number of copies.</p>
<p>What was best in Plato, considered as a freethinker, was his early
love of ratiocination, of &ldquo;the rendering and receiving of
reasons.&rdquo; Even in his earlier dialogues, however, there are signs
enough of an arbitrary temper, as well as of an inability to put
science in place of religious prejudice. The obscurantist doctrine
which he put in the mouth of Sokrates in the <i>Ph&aelig;drus</i> was
also his own, as we gather from the exposition in the <i>Republic</i>.
In that brilliant performance he objects, as so many believers and
freethinkers had done before him, to the scandalous tales in the poets
concerning the Gods and the sons of Gods; but he does not object to
them as being untrue. His position is that they are
unedifying.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10381src" href="#xd25e10381"
name="xd25e10381src">276</a> For his own part he proposes that his
ideal rulers frame new myths which shall edify the young: in his Utopia
it is part of the business of the legislator to choose the right
fictions;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10395src" href="#xd25e10395" name=
"xd25e10395src">277</a> and the systematic imposition of an edifying
body of pious fable on the general intelligence is part of his scheme
for the regeneration of society.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10400src"
href="#xd25e10400" name="xd25e10400src">278</a> Honesty is to be built
up by fraud, and reason by delusion. What the Hebrew Bible-makers
actually did, Plato proposed to do. The one thing to be said in his
favour is that by thus telling how the net is to be spread in the sight
of the bird he put the decisive obstacle&mdash;if any were
needed&mdash;in the way of his plan. It is, indeed, inconceivable that
the author of the <i>Republic</i> and the <i>Laws</i> dreamt that
either polity as a whole would ever come into existence. His plans of
suppressing all undesirable poetry, arranging community of women, and
enabling children to see battles, are the fancy-sketches of a
dilettant. He had failed completely as a statesman in practice; as a
schemer he does not even posit the first conditions of success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">As to his practical failure see the story of his and
his pupils&rsquo; attempts at Syracuse (Grote, <i>History</i>, ix,
37&ndash;123). The younger Dionysios, whom they had vainly attempted to
make a model ruler, seems to have been an audacious unbeliever to the
extent of plundering the temple of Persephone at Lokris, one of Jupiter
in the Peloponnesos, and one of &AElig;sculapius at Epidaurus. Clement
of Alexandria (<i>Protrept.</i> c. 4) states that he plundered
&ldquo;the statue of Jupiter in Sicily.&rdquo; Cicero (<i lang="la">De
nat. Deorum</i>, iii, 33, 34) and Valerius Maximus (i, 1) tell the
story of the elder Dionysios; but of him it cannot be true. In his day
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>plunder of the temples of
D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r and Persephone in Sicily by the Carthaginians
was counted a deadly sin. See Freeman, <i>History of Sicily</i>, iv,
125&ndash;47, and <i>Story of Sicily</i>, pp. 176&ndash;80. In
Cicero&rsquo;s dialogue it is noted that after all his impieties
Dionysios [the elder, of whom the stories are mistakenly told] died in
his bed. Athen&aelig;us, however, citing the biographer Klearchos,
tells that the younger Dionysios, after being reduced to the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of a begging priest of Kybel&ecirc;, ended his life
very miserably (xii, 60).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, the prescription of intolerance in the
<i>Laws</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e10444src" href="#xd25e10444"
name="xd25e10444src">279</a> classes Plato finally on the side of
fanaticism, and, indeed, ranks him with the most sinister figures on
that side, since his earlier writing shows that he would be willing to
punish men alike for repeating stories which they believed, and for
rejecting what <i>he</i> knew to be untruths.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10452src" href="#xd25e10452" name="xd25e10452src">280</a> By his
own late doctrine he vindicated the slayers of his own friend. His
psychology is as strange as that of Aristophanes, but strange with a
difference. He seems to have practised &ldquo;the will to
believe&rdquo; till he grew to be a fanatic on the plane of the most
ignorant of orthodox Athenians; and after all that science had done to
enlighten men on that natural order the misconceiving of which had been
the foundation of their creeds, he inveighs furiously in his old age
against the impiety of those who dared to doubt that the sun and moon
and stars were deities, as every nurse taught her charges.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10458src" href="#xd25e10458" name=
"xd25e10458src">281</a> And when all is said, his Gods satisfy no need
of the intelligence; for he insists that they only partially rule the

"xd25e10463src">282</a>&mdash;save insofar as evil may be a beneficent
penalty and discipline. At the same time, while advising the
imprisonment or execution of heretics who did not believe in the Gods,
Plato regarded with even greater detestation the man who taught that
they could be persuaded or propitiated by individual prayer and
sacrifice.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10469src" href="#xd25e10469"
name="xd25e10469src">283</a> Thus he would have struck alike at the
freethinking few and at the multitude who held by the general religious
beliefs of Greece, dealing damnation on all save his own clique, in a
way that would have made Torquemada blench.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10474src" href="#xd25e10474" name="xd25e10474src">284</a> In the
face of such teaching as this, it may well be said that &ldquo;Greek
philosophy made incomparably greater advances in the earlier polemic
period [of the Ionians] than after its friendly return to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>the
poetry of Homer and Hesiod&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10482src"
href="#xd25e10482" name="xd25e10482src">285</a>&mdash;that is, to their
polytheistic basis. It is to be said for Plato, finally, that his
embitterment at the downward course of things in Athens is a quite
intelligible source for his own intellectual decadence: a very similar
spectacle being seen in the case of our own great modern Utopist, Sir
Thomas More. But Plato&rsquo;s own writing bears witness that among the
unbelievers against whom he declaimed there were wise and blameless
citizens;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10507src" href="#xd25e10507" name=
"xd25e10507src">286</a> while in the act of seeking to lay a religious
basis for a good society he admitted the fundamental immorality of the
religious basis of the whole of past Greek life.</p>
<p>3. <span class="sc">Aristotle</span> [384&ndash;322], like Sokrates,
albeit in a very different way, rendered rather an indirect than a
direct service to Freethought. Where Sokrates gave the critical or
dialectic method or habit, &ldquo;a process of eternal value and of
universal application,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10517src"
href="#xd25e10517" name="xd25e10517src">287</a> Aristotle supplied the
great inspiration of system, partly correcting the Sokratic dogmatism
on the possibilities of science by endless observation and speculation,
though himself falling into scientific dogmatism only too often. That
he was an unbeliever in the popular and Platonic religion is clear.
Apart from the general rationalistic tenor of his works,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10523src" href="#xd25e10523" name=
"xd25e10523src">288</a> there was a current understanding that the
Peripatetic school denied the utility of prayer and sacrifice;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10529src" href="#xd25e10529" name=
"xd25e10529src">289</a> and though the essentially partisan attempt of
the anti-Macedonian party to impeach him for impiety may have turned
largely on his hyperbolic hymn to his dead friend Hermeias (who was a
eunuch, and as such held peculiarly unworthy of being addressed as on a
level with semi-divine heroes),<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10535src"
href="#xd25e10535" name="xd25e10535src">290</a> it could hardly have
been undertaken at all unless he had given solider pretexts. The
threatened prosecution he avoided by leaving the city, dying shortly
afterwards. Siding as he did with the Macedonian faction, he had put
himself out of touch with the democratic instincts of the Athenians,
and so doubly failed to affect their thinking. But nonetheless the
attack upon him by the democrats was a political stratagem. The
prosecution for blasphemy had now become a recognized weapon in
politics for all who had more piety than principle, and perhaps for
some who had neither. And Aristotle, well aware of the temper of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>population around him, had on the whole been so
guarded in his utterance that a fantastic pretext had to be fastened on
for his undoing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Prof. Bain (<i>Practical Essays</i>, p. 273), citing
Grote&rsquo;s remark on the &ldquo;cautious prose compositions of
Aristotle,&rdquo; comments thus: &ldquo;That is to say, the execution
of Sokrates was always before his eyes; he had to pare his expressions
so as not to give offence to Athenian orthodoxy. We can never know the
full bearings of such a disturbing force. The editors of Aristotle
complain of the corruption of his text: a far worse corruption lies
behind. In Greece Sokrates alone had the courage of his opinions. While
his views as to a future life, for example, are plain and frank, the
real opinion of Aristotle on the question is an insoluble
problem.&rdquo; (See, however, the passage in the <i>Metaphysics</i>
cited below.)</p>
<p>The opinion of Grote and Bain as to Aristotle&rsquo;s caution is
fully coincided in by Lange, who writes (<i lang="de">Gesch. des
Mater.</i> i, 63): &ldquo;More conservative than Plato and Sokrates,
Aristotle everywhere seeks to attach himself as closely as possible to
tradition, to popular notions, to the ideas embodied in common speech,
and his ethical postulates diverge as little as may be from the
customary morals and laws of Greek States. He has therefore been at all
times the favourite philosopher of conservative schools and
movements.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear, nevertheless, if we can be sure of his writings, that
he was a monotheist, but a monotheist with no practical religion.
&ldquo;Excluding such a thing as divine interference with Nature, his
theology, of course, excludes the possibility of revelation,
inspiration, miracles, and grace.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10562src" href="#xd25e10562" name="xd25e10562src">291</a> In a
passage in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, after elaborating his monistic
conception of Nature, he dismisses in one or two terse sentences the
whole current religion as a mass of myth framed to persuade the
multitude, in the interest of law and order.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10574src" href="#xd25e10574" name="xd25e10574src">292</a> His
influence must thus have been to some extent, at least, favourable to
rational science, though unhappily his own science is too often a
blundering reaction against the surmises of earlier thinkers with a
greater gift of intuition than he, who was rather a methodizer than a
discoverer.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10585src" href="#xd25e10585"
name="xd25e10585src">293</a> What was worst in his thinking was its
tendency to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>apriorism, which made it in a later age so
adaptable to the purposes of the Roman Catholic Church. Thus his
doctrines of the absolute levity of fire and of nature&rsquo;s
abhorrence of a vacuum set up a hypnotizing verbalism, and his dictum
that the earth is the centre of the universe was fatally helpful to
Christian obscurantism. For the rest, while guiltless of Plato&rsquo;s
fanaticism, he had no scheme of reform whatever, and was as far as any
other Greek from the thought of raising the mass by instruction. His
own science, indeed, was not progressive, save as regards his collation
of facts in biology; and his political ideals were rather reactionary;
his clear perception of the nature of the population problem leaving
him in the earlier attitude of Malthus, and his lack of sympathetic
energy making him a defender of slavery when other men had condemned
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10603src" href="#xd25e10603" name=
"xd25e10603src">294</a> He was in some aspects the greatest brain of
the ancient world; and he left it, at the close of the great Grecian
period, without much faith in man, while positing for the modern world
its vaguest conception of Deity. Plato and Aristotle between them had
reduced the ancient God-idea to a thin abstraction. Plato would not
have it that God was the author of evil, thus leaving evil unaccounted
for save by sorcery. Aristotle&rsquo;s God does nothing at all,
existing merely as a potentiality of thought. And yet upon those
positions were to be founded the theisms of the later world. Plato had
not striven, and Aristotle had failed, to create an adequate basis for
thought in real science; and the world gravitated back to religion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">[In previous editions I remarked that &ldquo;the lack
of fresh science, which was the proximate cause of the stagnation of
Greek thought, has been explained like other things as a result of race
qualities: &lsquo;the Athenians,&rsquo; says Mr. Benn (<i>The Greek
Philosophers</i>, i, 42), &lsquo;had no genius for natural science:
none of them were ever distinguished as savans&#8202;&hellip;. It was,
they thought, a miserable trifling [and] waste of time&#8202;&hellip;.
Pericles, indeed, thought differently&#8202;&hellip;.&rsquo; On the
other hand, Lange decides (i, 6) &ldquo;that with the freedom and
boldness of the Hellenic spirit was combined &hellip; the talent for
scientific deduction.<a id="xd25e10614" name="xd25e10614"></a> These
contrary views,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;seem alike arbitrary. If Mr.
Benn means that other Hellenes had what the Athenians lacked, the
answer is that only special social conditions could have set up such a
difference, and that it could not be innate, but must be a mere matter
of usage.&rdquo; Mr. Benn has explained to me that he does not dissent
from this view, and that I had not rightly gathered his from the
passage I quoted. In his later work, <i>The Philosophy of Greece
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>considered in relation to the character and
history of its people</i> (1898), he has pointed out how, in the period
of Hippias and Prodikos, &ldquo;at Athens in particular young men threw
themselves with ardour into the investigation of&rdquo; problems of
cosmography, astronomy, meteorology, and comparative anatomy (p. 138).
The hindering forces were Athenian bigotry (pp. 113&ndash;14, 171) and
the mischievous influence of Sokrates (pp. 165, 173).</p>
<p>Speaking broadly, we may say that the Chaldeans were forward in
astronomy because their climate favoured it to begin with, and religion
and their superstitions did so later. Hippokrates of Kos became a great
physician because, with natural capacity, he had the opportunity to
compare many practices. The Athenians failed to carry on the sciences,
not because the faculty or the taste was lacking among them, but
because their political and artistic interests, for one thing,
preoccupied them&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Sokrates and Plato; and because,
for another, their popular religion, popularly supported, menaced the
students of physics. But the Ionians, who <i>had</i> savans, failed
equally to progress after the Alexandrian period; the explanation being
again not stoppage of faculty, but the advent of conditions
unfavourable to the old intellectual life, which in any case, as we
saw, had been first set up by Babylonian contacts. (Compare, on the
ethnological theorem of Cousin, G. Br&eacute;ton, <i lang="fr">Essai
sur la po&eacute;sie philos. en Gr&egrave;ce</i>, p. 10.) On the other
hand, Lange&rsquo;s theory of gifts &ldquo;innate&rdquo; in the
Hellenic mind in general is the old racial fallacy. Potentialities are
&ldquo;innate&rdquo; in all populations, according to their culture
stage, and it was their total environment that specialized the Greeks
as a community.]</p>

<p class="first">The overthrow of the &ldquo;free&rdquo; political life
of Athens was followed by a certain increase in intellectual activity,
the result of throwing back the remaining store of energy on the life
of the mind. By this time an almost open unbelief as to the current
tales concerning the Gods would seem to have become general among
educated people, the withdrawal of the old risk of impeachment by
political factions being so far favourable to outspokenness. It is on
record that the historian <span class="sc">Ephoros</span> (of
Cum&aelig; in &AElig;olia: fl. 350 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>), who
was a pupil of Isocrates, openly hinted in his work at his disbelief in
the oracle of Apollo, and in fabulous traditions generally.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10644src" href="#xd25e10644" name=
"xd25e10644src">295</a> In other directions there were similar signs of
freethought. The new schools of philosophy founded by <span class=
"sc">Zeno</span> the Stoic (fl. 280: d. 263 or 259) <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>and
<span class="sc">Epicurus</span> (341&ndash;270), whatever their
defects, compare not ill with those of Plato and Aristotle, exhibiting
greater ethical sanity and sincerity if less metaphysical subtlety. Of
metaphysics there had been enough for the age: what it needed was a
rational philosophy of life. But the loss of political freedom,
although thus for a time turned to account, was fatal to continuous
progress. The first great thinkers had all been free men in a
politically free environment: the atmosphere of cowed subjection,
especially after the advent of the Romans, could not breed their like;
and originative energy of the higher order soon disappeared. Sane as
was the moral philosophy of Epicurus, and austere as was that of Zeno,
they are alike static or quietist,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10656src"
href="#xd25e10656" name="xd25e10656src">296</a> the codes of a society
seeking a regulating and sustaining principle rather than hopeful of
new achievement or new truth. And the universal skepticism of
<span class="sc">Pyrrho</span> has the same effect of suggesting that
what is wanted is not progress, but balance. It is significant that he,
who carried the Sokratic profession of Nescience to the typical extreme
of doctrinal Nihilism, was made high-priest of his native town of Elis,
and had statues erected in his honour.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10665src" href="#xd25e10665" name="xd25e10665src">297</a></p>
<p>Considered as freethinkers, all three men tell at once of the
critical and of the reactionary work done by the previous age. Pyrrho,
the universal doubter, appears to have taken for granted, with the
whole of his followers, such propositions as that some animals (not
insects) are produced by parthenogenesis, that some live in the fire,
and that the legend of the Ph&oelig;nix is true.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10676src" href="#xd25e10676" name="xd25e10676src">298</a> Such
credences stood for the arrest of biological science in the Sokratic
age, with Aristotle, so often mistakenly, at work; while, on the other
hand, the Sokratic skepticism visibly motives the play of systematic
doubt on the dogmas men had learned to question. Zeno, again, was
substantially a monotheist; Epicurus, adopting but not greatly
developing the science of Demokritos,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10685src" href="#xd25e10685" name="xd25e10685src">299</a> turned
the Gods into a far-off band of glorious spectres, untroubled by human
needs, dwelling for ever in immortal calm, neither ruling nor caring
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>to rule the world of men.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10702src" href="#xd25e10702" name="xd25e10702src">300</a> In
coming to this surprising compromise, Epicurus, indeed, probably did
not carry with him the whole intelligence even of his own school. His
friend, the second Metrodoros of Lampsakos, seems to have been the most
stringent of all the censors of Homer, wholly ignoring his
namesake&rsquo;s attempts to clear the bard of impiety. &ldquo;He even
advised men not to be ashamed to confess their utter ignorance of
Homer, to the extent of not knowing whether Hector was a Greek or a
Trojan.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10705src" href="#xd25e10705"
name="xd25e10705src">301</a> Such austerity towards myths can hardly
have been compatible with the acceptance of the residuum of Epicurus.
That, however, became the standing creed of the sect, and a fruitful
theme of derision to its opponents. Doubtless the comfort of avoiding
direct conflict with the popular beliefs had a good deal to do with the
acceptance of the doctrine.</p>
<p>This strange retention of the theorem of the existence of
anthropomorphic Gods, with a flat denial that they did anything in the
universe, might be termed the great peculiarity of average ancient
rationalism, were it not that what makes it at all intelligible for us
is just the similar practice of modern non-Christian theists. The Gods
of antiquity were non-creative, but strivers and meddlers and answerers
of prayer; and ancient rationalism relieved them of their striving and
meddling, leaving them no active or governing function whatever, but
for the most part cherishing their phantasms. The God of modern
Christendom had been at once a creator and a governor, ruling,
meddling, punishing, rewarding, and hearing prayer; and modern theism,
unable to take the atheistic or agnostic plunge, relieves him of all
interference in things human or cosmic, but retains him as a creative
abstraction who somehow set up &ldquo;law,&rdquo; whether or not he
made all things out of nothing. The psychological process in the two
cases seems to be the same&mdash;an erection of &aelig;sthetic habit
into a philosophic dogma, and an accommodation of phrase to popular
prejudice.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the logical and psychological crudities of
Epicureanism, however, it counted for much as a deliverance of men from
superstitious fears; and nothing is more remarkable in the history of
ancient philosophy than the affectionate reverence paid to the
founder&rsquo;s memory<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10720src" href=
"#xd25e10720" name="xd25e10720src">302</a> on this score through whole
centuries. The powerful Lucretius sounds his highest note of praise in
telling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>how this Greek had first of all men freed human
life from the crashing load of religion, daring to pass the flaming
ramparts of the world, and by his victory putting men on an equality
with heaven.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10731src" href="#xd25e10731"

position of a verbal theism. The atheist is said to have been menaced
by Athenian law in the time of Demetrius Phalereus, who protected him;

hemlock;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10785src" href="#xd25e10785" name=

<p>In the same age the same freethinking temper is seen in <span class=

is said to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184"

offence of saying that the Pheidian statue of Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; was

<i>hetairai</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10929src" href=
"#xd25e10929" name="xd25e10929src">325</a> In any case, the principle
seems to have had considerable vogue in the later Hellenistic world;
but with the effect rather of paving the way for new cults than of
setting up scientific rationalism in place of the old ones. Quite a
number of writers like Palaiphatos, without going so far as
Ev&ecirc;meros, sought to reduce myths to natural possibilities and
events, by way of mediating between the credulous and the
incredulous.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10935src" href="#xd25e10935"
name="xd25e10935src">326</a> Their method is mostly the na&iuml;f one
revived by the Abb&eacute; Banier in the eighteenth century of reducing
marvels to verbal misconceptions. Thus for Palaiphatos the myth of
Kerberos came from the facts that the city Trikarenos was commonly
spoken of as a beautiful and great dog; and that Geryon, who lived
there, had great dogs called Kerberoi; Act&aelig;on was &ldquo;devoured
by his dogs&rdquo; in the sense that he neglected his affairs and
wasted his time in hunting; the Amazons were shaved men, clad as were
the women in Thrace, and so on.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10941src"
href="#xd25e10941" name="xd25e10941src">327</a> Palaiphatos and the
Herakleitos who also wrote <i lang="la">De Incredibilibus</i> agree
that Pasiphae&rsquo;s bull was a man named Tauros; and the latter
writer similarly explains that Scylla was a beautiful <i>hetaira</i>
with avaricious hangers-on, and that the harpies were ladies of the
same profession. If the method seems childish, it is to be remembered
that as regards the explanation of supernatural events it was adhered
to by German theologians of a century ago; and that its credulity in
incredulity is still to be seen in the current view that every
narrative in the sacred books is to be taken as necessarily standing
for a fact of some kind.</p>
<p>One of the inferrible effects of the Ev&ecirc;merist method was to
facilitate for the time the adoption of the Egyptian and eastern usage
of deifying kings. It has been plausibly argued that this practice
stands not so much for superstition as for skepticism, its opponents
being precisely the orthodox believers, and its promoters those who had
learned to doubt the actuality of the traditional Gods. Ev&ecirc;merism
would clinch such a tendency; and it is noteworthy that Ev&ecirc;meros
lived at the court of Kassander (319&ndash;296 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>) in a period in which every remaining member of the
family of the deified Alexander had perished, mostly by violence; while
the contemporary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186"

<i>Sot&ecirc;r</i>, &ldquo;Saviour,&rdquo; from the people of
Rhodes.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10964src" href="#xd25e10964" name=
"xd25e10964src">328</a> It is to be observed, however, that while in
the next generation Antiochus I of Syria received the same title, and
his successor Antiochus II that of <i>Theos</i>, &ldquo;God,&rdquo; the
usage passes away; Ptolemy III being named merely
<i>Everget&ecirc;s</i>, &ldquo;the Benefactor&rdquo; (of the priests),
and even Antiochus III only &ldquo;the Great.&rdquo; Superstition was
not to be ousted by a political exploitation of its machinery.<a class=

<p>In Athens the democracy, restored in a subordinate form by
Kassander&rsquo;s opponent, Demetrius Poliork&ecirc;tes (307
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>), actually tried to put down the
philosophic schools, all of which, but the Aristotelian in particular,
were anti-democratic, and doubtless also comparatively irreligious.
Epicurus and some of his antagonists were exiled within a year of his
opening his school (306 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>); but the law was
repealed in the following year.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10997src"
href="#xd25e10997" name="xd25e10997src">330</a> Theophrastos, the head

impiety, which seems to have consisted in denouncing animal
sacrifice.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11003src" href="#xd25e11003"
name="xd25e11003src">331</a> These repressive attempts, however,
failed; and no others followed at Athens in that era; though in the
next century the Epicureans seem to have been expelled from Lythos in
Crete and from Messen&ecirc; in the Peloponnesos, nominally for their
atheism, in reality probably on political grounds.<a class="noteref"

<p>It was in keeping with this general but mostly placid and
non-polemic latitudinarianism that the New Academy, the second birth,
or rather transformation, of the Platonic school, in the hands of
<span class="sc">Arkesilaos</span> and the great <span class=
"sc">Carneades</span> (213&ndash;129), and later of the Carthaginian
<span class="sc">Clitomachos</span>, should be marked by that species
of skepticism thence called Academic&mdash;a skepticism which exposed
the doubtfulness of current religious beliefs without going the
Pyrrhonian length of denying that any beliefs could be proved, or even
denying the existence of the Gods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">For the arguments of Carneades against the Stoic
doctrine of immortality see Cicero, <i lang="la">De natura Deorum</i>,
iii, 12, 17; and for his argument against theism see Sextus Empiricus,
<i lang="la">Adv. Math.</i> ix, 172, 183. Mr. Benn pronounces this
criticism of theology &ldquo;the most destructive that has ever
appeared, the armoury whence religious skepticism ever since has been
supplied&rdquo; (<i>The Philosophy of Greece</i>, etc., p. 258). This
seems an over-statement. But it is just to say, as does Mr. Whittaker
(<i>Priests, Philosophers, and Prophets</i>, 1911, p. 60; cp. p. 86),
that &ldquo;there has never been a more drastic attack than that of
Carneades, which furnished Cicero with the materials for his second
book, <i>On Divination</i>&rdquo;; and, as does Prof. Martha (<i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;tudes Morales sur l&rsquo;antiquit&eacute;</i>, 1889, p.
77), that no philosophic or religious school has been able to ignore
the problems which Carneades raised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As against the essentially uncritical Stoics, the criticism of
Carneades is sane and sound; and he has been termed by judicious
moderns &ldquo;the greatest skeptical mind of antiquity&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e11099src" href="#xd25e11099" name=
"xd25e11099src">338</a> and &ldquo;the Bayle of
Antiquity&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11102src" href=
"#xd25e11102" name="xd25e11102src">339</a> though he seems to have
written nothing.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11105src" href=
"#xd25e11105" name="xd25e11105src">340</a> There is such a concurrence
of testimony as to the victorious power of his oratory and the
invincible skill of his dialectic<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11108src"
href="#xd25e11108" name="xd25e11108src">341</a> that he must be
reckoned one of the great intellectual and rationalizing forces of his
day, triumphing as he did in the two diverse arenas of Greece and Rome.
His disciple and successor Clitomachos said of him, with Cicero&rsquo;s
assent, that he had achieved a labour of Hercules &ldquo;in liberating
our souls as it were of a fierce monster, credulity, conjecture, rash
belief.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11122src" href="#xd25e11122"
name="xd25e11122src">342</a> He was, in short, a mighty antagonist of
thoughtless beliefs, clearing the ground for a rational life; and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>fact that he was chosen with Diogenes the
Peripatetic and Critolaos the Stoic to go to Rome to plead the cause of
ruined Athens, mulcted in an enormous fine, proved that he was held in
high honour at home. Athens, in short, was not at this stage &ldquo;too
superstitious.&rdquo; Unreasoning faith was largely discredited by
philosophy.</p>
<p>On this basis, in a healthy environment, science and energy might
have reared a constructive rationalism; and for a time astronomy, in
the hands of <span class="sc">Aristarchos</span> of Samos (third
century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>), <span class=
"sc">Eratosthenes</span> of Cyrene, the second keeper of the great
Alexandrian library (2nd cent. <span class="sc">B.C.</span>), and above
all of <span class="sc">Hipparchos</span> of Nikaia, who did most of
his work in the island of Rhodes, was carried to a height of mastery
which could not be maintained, and was re-attained only in modern
times.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11150src" href="#xd25e11150" name=
"xd25e11150src">343</a> Thus much could be accomplished by
&ldquo;endowment of research&rdquo; as practised by the Ptolemies at
Alexandria; and after science had declined with the decline of their
polity, and still further under Roman rule, the new cosmopolitanism of
the second century of the empire reverted to the principle of
intelligent evocation, producing under the Antonines the
&ldquo;Second&rdquo; School of Alexandria.</p>
<p>But the social conditions remained fundamentally bad; and the
earlier greatness was never recovered. &ldquo;History records not one
astronomer of note in the three centuries between Hipparchos and
Ptolemy&rdquo;; and Ptolemy (fl. 140 <span class="sc">C.E.</span>) not
only retrograded into astronomical error, but elaborated on oriental
lines a baseless fabric of astrology.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11172src" href="#xd25e11172" name="xd25e11172src">344</a> Other
science mostly decayed likewise. The Greek world, already led to lower
intellectual levels by the sudden ease and wealth opened up to it
through the conquests of Alexander and the rule of his successors, was
cast still lower by the Roman conquest. Pliny, extolling Hipparchos
with little comprehension of his work, must needs pronounce him to have
&ldquo;dared a thing displeasing to God&rdquo; in numbering the stars
for posterity.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11178src" href="#xd25e11178"
name="xd25e11178src">345</a> In the air of imperialism, stirred by no
other, original thought could not arise; and the mass of the
Greek-speaking populations, rich and poor, gravitated to the level of
the intellectual<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11183src" href=
"#xd25e11183" name="xd25e11183src">346</a> and emotional life of more
or less well-fed slaves. In this society there rapidly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>multiplied private religious
associations&mdash;<i>thiasoi</i>, <i>eranoi</i>,
<i>orgeones</i>&mdash;in which men and women, denied political life,
found new bonds of union and grounds of division in cultivating
worships, mostly oriental, which stimulated the religious sense and
sentiment.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11204src" href="#xd25e11204"
name="xd25e11204src">347</a></p>
<p>Such was the soil in which Christianity took root and flourished;
while philosophy, after the freethinking epoch following on the fall of
Athenian power, gradually reverted to one or other form of mystical
theism or theosophy, of which the most successful was the Neo-Platonism
of Alexandria.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11212src" href="#xd25e11212"
name="xd25e11212src">348</a> When the theosophic Julian rejoiced that
Epicureanism had disappeared,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11218src"
href="#xd25e11218" name="xd25e11218src">349</a> he was exulting in a
symptom of the intellectual decline that made possible the triumph of
the faith he most opposed. Christianity furthered a decadence thus
begun under the auspices of pagan imperialism; and &ldquo;the fifth
century of the Christian era witnessed an almost total extinction of
the sciences in Alexandria&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11221src"
href="#xd25e11221" name="xd25e11221src">350</a>&mdash;an admission
which disposes of the dispute as to the guilt of the Arabs in
destroying the great library.</p>
<p>Here and there, through the centuries, the old intellectual flame
burns whitely enough: the noble figure of <span class=
"sc">Epictetus</span> in the first century of the new era, and that of
the brilliant <span class="sc">Lucian</span> in the second, in their
widely different ways remind us that the evolved faculty was still
there if the circumstances had been such as to evoke it. <span class=
"sc">Menippos</span> in the first century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>
had played a similar part to that of Lucian, in whose freethinking
dialogues he so often figures; but with less of subtlety and
intellectuality. Lucian&rsquo;s was indeed a mind of the rarest
lucidity; and the argumentation of his dialogue <i>Zeus
Trag&aelig;dos</i> covers every one of the main aspects of the theistic
problem. There is no dubiety as to his atheistic conclusion, which is
smilingly implicit in the reminder he puts in the mouth of Hermes,
that, though a few men may adopt the atheistic view, &ldquo;there will
always be plenty of others who think the contrary&mdash;the majority of
the Greeks, the ignorant many, the populace, and all the
barbarians.&rdquo; But the moral doctrine of Epictetus is one of
endurance and resignation; and the almost unvarying raillery of Lucian,
making mere perpetual sport of the now moribund Olympian Gods, was
hardly better fitted than the all-round skepticism of the school of
<span class="sc">Sextus Empiricus</span> to inspire positive and
progressive thinking.</p>
<p>This latter school, described by Cicero as dispersed and extinct
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>in his day,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11252src"
href="#xd25e11252" name="xd25e11252src">351</a> appears to have been
revived in the first century by &AElig;nesidemos, who taught at
Alexandria.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11260src" href="#xd25e11260"
name="xd25e11260src">352</a> It seems to have been through him in
particular that the Pyrrhonic system took the clear-cut form in which
it is presented at the close of the second century by the accomplished
Sextus &ldquo;Empiricus&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the empirical
(<i>i.e.</i>, experiential) physician,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11269src" href="#xd25e11269" name="xd25e11269src">353</a> who
lived at Alexandria and Athens (fl. 175&ndash;205 <span class=
"sc">C.E.</span>). As a whole, the school continued to discredit
dogmatism without promoting knowledge. Sextus, it is true, strikes
acutely and systematically at ill-founded beliefs, and so makes for
reason;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11279src" href="#xd25e11279" name=
"xd25e11279src">354</a> but, like the whole Pyrrhonian school, he has
no idea of a method which shall reach sounder conclusions. As the
Stoics had inculcated the control of the passions as such, so the
skeptics undertook to make men rise above the prejudices and
presuppositions which swayed them no less blindly than ever did their
passions. But Sextus follows a purely skeptical method, never rising
from the destruction of false beliefs to the establishment of true. His
aim is <i>ataraxia</i>, a philosophic calm of non-belief in any
dogmatic affirmation beyond the positing of phenomena as such; and
while such an attitude is beneficently exclusive of all fanaticism, it
unfortunately never makes any impression on the more intolerant
fanatic, who is shaken only by giving him a measure of critical truth
in place of his error. And as Sextus addressed himself to the students
of philosophy, not to the simple believers in the Gods, he had no wide
influence.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11290src" href="#xd25e11290"
name="xd25e11290src">355</a> Avowedly accepting the normal view of
moral obligations while rejecting dogmatic theories of their basis, the
doctrine of the strict skeptics had the effect, from Pyrrho onwards, of
giving the same acceptance to the common religion, merely rejecting the
philosophic pretence of justifying it. Taken by themselves, the
arguments against current theism in the third book of the
<i>Hypotyposes</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e11295src" href=
"#xd25e11295" name="xd25e11295src">356</a> are unanswerable; but, when
bracketed with other arguments against the ordinary belief in
causation, they had the effect of leaving theism on a par with that
belief. Against religious beliefs in particular, therefore, they had no
wide destructive effect.</p>
<p>Lucian, again, thought soundly and sincerely on life; his praise of
the men whose memories he respected, as Epicurus and Demonax (if the
Life of Demonax attributed to him be really his), is grave and
heartfelt; and his ridicule of the discredited Gods was perfectly right
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>so far as it went. It is certain that the
unbelievers and the skeptics alike held their own with the believers in
the matter of right living.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11302src" href=
"#xd25e11302" name="xd25e11302src">357</a> In the period of declining
pagan belief, the maxim that superstition was a good thing for the
people must have wrought a quantity and a kind of corruption that no
amount of ridicule of religion could ever approach. Polybius (fl. 150
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>) agrees with his complacent Roman masters
that their greatness is largely due to the carefully cultivated
superstition of their populace, and charges with rashness and folly
those who would uproot the growth;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11311src"
href="#xd25e11311" name="xd25e11311src">358</a> and Strabo, writing
under Tiberius&mdash;unless it be a later interpolator of his
work&mdash;confidently lays down the same principle of governmental
deceit,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11314src" href="#xd25e11314" name=
"xd25e11314src">359</a> though in an apparently quite genuine passage
he vehemently protests the incredibility of the traditional tales about
Apollo.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11321src" href="#xd25e11321" name=
"xd25e11321src">360</a> So far had the doctrine evolved since Plato
preached it. But to countervail it there needed more than a ridicule
which after all reached only the class who had already cast off the
beliefs derided, leaving the multitude unenlightened. The lack of the
needed machinery of enlightenment was, of course, part of the general
failure of the Gr&aelig;co-Roman civilization; and no one man&rsquo;s
efforts could have availed, even if any man of the age could have
grasped the whole situation. Rather the principle of esoteric
enlightenment, the ideal of secret knowledge, took stronger hold as the
mass grew more and more comprehensively superstitious. Even at the
beginning of the Christian era the view that Homer&rsquo;s deities were
allegorical beings was freshly propounded in the writings of
Herakleides and Cornutus (Phornutus); but it served only as a kind of
mystical <i>Gnosis</i>, on all fours with Christian Gnosticism, and was
finally taken up by Neo-Platonists, who were no nearer rationalism for
adopting it.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11330src" href="#xd25e11330"
name="xd25e11330src">361</a></p>
<p>So with the rationalism to which we have so many uneasy or hostile
allusions in Plutarch. We find him resenting the scoffs of Epicureans
at the doctrine of Providence, and recoiling from the &ldquo;abyss of
impiety&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11344src" href="#xd25e11344"
name="xd25e11344src">362</a> opened up by those who say that
&ldquo;Aphrodite is simply desire, and Hermes eloquence, and the Muses
the arts and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>sciences, and Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; wisdom, and
Dionysos merely wine, Hephaistos fire, and D&ecirc;m&ecirc;t&ecirc;r
corn&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11354src" href="#xd25e11354"
name="xd25e11354src">363</a> and in his essay <i>On Superstition</i> he
regretfully recognizes the existence of many rational atheists,
confessing that their state of mind is better than that of the
superstitious who abound around him, with their &ldquo;impure
purifications and unclean cleansings,&rdquo; their barbaric rites, and
their evil Gods. But the unbelievers, with their keen contempt for
popular folly, availed as little against it as Plutarch himself, with
his doctrine of a just mean. The one effectual cure would have been
widened knowledge; and of such an evolution the social conditions did
not permit.</p>
<p>To return to a state of admiration for the total outcome of Greek
thought, then, it is necessary to pass from the standpoint of simple
analysis to that of comparison. It is in contrast with the relatively
slight achievement of the other ancient civilizations that the Greek,
at its height, still stands out for posterity as a wonderful growth.
That which, tried by the test of ideals, is as a whole only one more
tragic chapter in the record of human frustration, yet contains within
it light and leading as well as warning; and for long ages it was as a
lost Paradise to a darkened world. It has been not untruly said that
&ldquo;the Greek spirit is immortal, because it was
free&rdquo;:<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11370src" href="#xd25e11370"
name="xd25e11370src">364</a> free not as science can now conceive
freedom, but in contrast with the spiritual bondage of Jewry and Egypt,
the half-barbaric tradition of imperial Babylon, and the short flight
of mental life in Rome. Above all, it was ever in virtue of the freedom
that the high things were accomplished; and it was ever the falling
away from freedom, the tyranny either of common ignorance or of
mindless power, that wrought decadence. There is a danger, too, of
injustice in comparing Athens with later States. When a high authority
pronounces that &ldquo;the religious views of the Demos were of the
narrowest kind,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11378src" href=
"#xd25e11378" name="xd25e11378src">365</a> he is not to be gainsaid;
but the further verdict that &ldquo;hardly any people has sinned more
heavily against the liberty of science&rdquo; is unduly lenient to
Christian civilization. The heaviest sins of that against science,
indeed, lie at the door of the Catholic Church; but to make that an
exoneration of the modern &ldquo;peoples&rdquo; as against the ancient
would be to load the scales. And even apart from the Catholic Church,
which practically suppressed all science for a thousand years, the
attitude of Protestant leaders and Protestant peoples, from Luther down
to the second half of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href=
"#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>nineteenth century, has been one
of hatred and persecution towards all science that clashed with the
sacred books.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11386src" href="#xd25e11386"
name="xd25e11386src">366</a> In the Greek world there was more
scientific discussion in the three hundred years down to Epicurus than
took place in the whole of Christian Europe in thirteen hundred; and
the amount of actual violence used towards innovators in the pagan
period, though lamentable enough, was trifling in comparison with that
recorded in Christian history, to say nothing of the frightful annals
of witch-burning, to which there is no parallel in civilized heathen
history. The critic, too, goes on to admit that, while &ldquo;Sokrates,
Anaxagoras, and Aristotle fell victims in different degrees to the
bigotry of the populace,&rdquo; &ldquo;of course their offence was
political rather than religious. They were condemned not as heretics,
but as innovators in the <i>state</i> religion.&rdquo; And, as we have
seen, all three of the men named taught in freedom for many years till
political faction turned popular bigotry against them. The true measure
of Athenian narrowness is not to be reached, therefore, without keeping
in view the long series of modern outrages and maledictions against the
makers and introducers of new machinery, and the multitude of such
episodes as the treatment of Priestley in Christian Birmingham, little
more than a century ago. On a full comparison the Greeks come out not
ill.</p>
<p>It was, in fact, impossible that the Greeks should either stifle or
persecute science or freethought as it was either stifled or persecuted
by ancient Jews (who had almost no science by reason of their theology)
or by modern Christians, simply because the Greeks had no
anti-scientific hieratic <i>literature</i>. It remains profoundly
significant for science that the ancient civilization which on the
smallest area evolved the most admirable life, which most completely
transcended all the sources from which it originally drew, and left a
record by which men are still charmed and taught, was a civilization as
nearly as might be without Sacred Books, without an organized

seems arguable that the aversion of Aristophanes to Euripides was
primarily artistic, arising in dislike of some of the features of his
style. On this head his must be reckoned an expert judgment. The old
criticism found in Euripides literary vices; the new seems to ignore
the issue. But a clerical scholar pronounces that &ldquo;Aristophanes
was the most unreasoning <i lang="la">laudator temporis acti</i>.
Genius and poet as he was, he was the sworn foe to intellectual
progress.&rdquo; Hence his hatred of Euripides and his championship of

Diog. La&euml;rt. bk. ix, ch. xi, 5, &sect; 64. The lengthy notice
given by Diogenes shows the impression Pyrrho&rsquo;s teaching made.
See a full account of it, so far as known, in the Rev. J. Owen&rsquo;s

These propositions occur in the first of the ten Pyrrhonian

the authorship is commonly assigned to &AElig;nesidemos (fl.
80&ndash;50). Cp. Owen, <i>Evenings with the Skeptics</i>, i, 290,

<p class="first">The Romans, so much later than the Greeks in their
intellectual development, were in some respects peculiarly apt&mdash;in
the case of their upper class&mdash;to accept freethinking ideas when
Greek rationalism at length reached them. After receiving from their
Greek neighbours in Southern Italy, in the pre-historic period, the
germs of higher culture, in particular the alphabet, they rather
retrograded than progressed for centuries, the very alphabet
degenerating for lack of literary activity<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11413src" href="#xd25e11413" name="xd25e11413src">1</a> in the
absence of any culture class, and under the one-idea&rsquo;d rule of
the landowning aristocracy, whose bent to military aggression was
correlative to the smallness of the Roman facilities for commerce. In
the earlier ages nearly everything in the nature of written lore was a
specialty of a few priests, and was limited to their purposes, which
included some keeping of annals.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11431src"
href="#xd25e11431" name="xd25e11431src">2</a> The use of writing for
purposes of family records seems to have been the first literary
development among the patrician laity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11437src" href="#xd25e11437" name="xd25e11437src">3</a> In the
early republican period, however, the same conditions of relative
poverty, militarism, and aristocratic emulation prevented any
development even of the priesthood beyond the rudimentary stage of a
primitive civic function; and the whole of these conditions in
combination kept the Roman Pantheon peculiarly shadowy, and the Roman
mythology abnormally undeveloped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The character of the religion of the Romans has been
usually explained in the old manner, in terms of their particular
&ldquo;genius&rdquo; and lack of genius. On this view the Romans
primordially tended to do whatever they did&mdash;to be slightly
religious in one period, and highly so in another. Teuffel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>quite unconsciously reduces the theorem to
absurdity in two phrases: &ldquo;As long as the <i>peculiar character
of the Roman nation remained unaltered</i>&rdquo; &hellip; (<i>Hist. of
Roman Lit.</i> ed. Schwabe, Eng. tr. 1900, i, 2): &ldquo;the
<i>peculiar Roman character had now come to an end, and for
ever</i>&rdquo; (<i>id.</i> p. 123). By no writer has the subject been
more unphilosophically treated than by Mommsen, whose chapter on Roman
religion (vol. i, ch. xii) is an insoluble series of contradictions.
(See the present writer&rsquo;s <i>Christianity and Mythology</i>, pp.
115&ndash;17.) M. Boissier contradicts himself hardly less strangely,
alternately pronouncing the Latin religion timid and confident,
prostrate and dignified (<i lang="fr">La religion romaine
d&rsquo;Auguste aux Antonins</i>, 4e &eacute;dit. i, 7, 8, 26, 28).
Both writers ascribe every characteristic of Roman religion to the
character of &ldquo;the Romans&rdquo; in the lump&mdash;a method which
excludes any orderly conception. It must be abandoned if there is to be
any true comprehension of the subject.</p>
<p>Other verdicts of this kind by Ihne, Jevons, and others, will no
better bear examination. (See <i>Christianity and Mythology</i>, pt. i,
ch. iii, &sect; 3.) Dr. Warde Fowler, the latest English specialist to
handle the question, confidently supports the strange thesis (dating
from Schwartz) that the multitude of deities and daimons of the early
Latins were never thought of as personal, or as possessing sex, until
Greek mythology and sculpture set the fashion of such conceptions,
whereupon &ldquo;this later and foreign notion of divinity so
completely took possession of the minds of the Romans of the
cosmopolitan city that Varro is the only writer who has preserved the
tradition of the older way of thinking&rdquo; (<i>The Religious
Experience of the Roman People</i>, 1911, p. 147). That is to say, the
conception of the Gods in the imageless period was an &ldquo;older way
of <i>thinking</i>,&rdquo; in which deities called by male and female
names, and often addressed as <i>Pater</i> and <i>Mater</i>, were not
really thought of as anthropomorphic at all! <i>How</i> the early
Romans conceived their non-imaged deities Dr. Fowler naturally does not
attempt to suggest. We get merely the unreasoned and unexplained
negative formula that &ldquo;we may take it as certain that even the
greater deities of the calendar, Janus, Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus, and
Vesta, <i>were not thought of as existing in any sense in human form,
nor as personal beings having any human characteristics</i>. The early
Romans were <i>destitute of mythological fancy</i>&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Either, then, the early Romans were psychologically alien to every
other primitive or barbaric people, as known to modern anthropology,
or, by parity of reasoning, <i>all</i> anthropomorphism is the
spontaneous creation of sculptors, <i>who had no ground whatever in
previous psychosis for making images of Gods</i>. The <i>Greeks</i>, on
this view, had no anthropomorphic notion of their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>deities until suddenly sculptors began to make
images of them, whereupon everybody promptly and obediently
anthropomorphized!</p>
<p>The way out of this hopeless theorem is indicated for Dr. Fowler by
his own repeated observation that the Roman <i lang="la">jus
divinum</i>, in which he finds so little sign of normal
&ldquo;mythological fancy,&rdquo; represented the deliberately
restrictive action of an official priesthood for whom all <i lang=
"la">religio</i> was a kind of State magic or &ldquo;medicine.&rdquo;
He expressly insists (p. 24) on &ldquo;the wonderful work done by the
early authorities from the State in <i>eliminating</i> from their rule
of worship (<i lang="la">jus divinum</i>) almost all that was magical,
barbarous, or, as later Romans would have called it,
superstitious&rdquo; (Lect. ii, p. 24; cp. Lect. iii.). He even
inclines to the view that the patrician religion &ldquo;was really the
religion of an invading race, like that of the Ach&aelig;ans in Greece,
engrafted on the religion of a primitive and less civilized
population&rdquo; (pp. viii, 23). This thesis is not necessary to the
rebuttal of his previous negation; but it obviously resists it, unless
we are to make the word &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; apply only to patricians.
An invading tribe might, in the case of Rome as in that of the Homeric
Greeks, abandon ordinary and <i>localized</i> primitive beliefs which
it had held in its previous home, and thereafter be officially
reluctant to recognize the local superstitions of its conquered
<i>plebs</i>.</p>
<p>But the Roman case can be understood without assuming any continuity
of racial divergence. Livy shows us that the Latin peasantry were, if
possible, <i>more</i> given to superstitious fears and panics than any
other, constantly reporting portents and <i>prodigia</i> which called
for State ritual, and embarrassing military policy by their
apprehensions. A patrician priesthood, concerned above all things for
public polity, would in such circumstances naturally seek to minimize
the personal side of the popular mythology, treating all orders of
divinity as mere classes of powers to be appeased. The fact (<i>id.</i>
p. 29) that among the early Romans, as among other primitives, women
were rigidly excluded from certain <i lang="la">sacra</i> points to a
further ground for keeping out of official sight the sex life of the
Gods. But the very ritual formula of the Fratres Arvales, <i lang=
"la">Sive deus sive dea</i> (p. 149), proves that the deities were
habitually thought of as personal, and male or female.</p>
<p>Dr. Fowler alternately and inconsistently argues that the
&ldquo;vulgar mind was ready to think of God-couples&rdquo; (p. 152),
and that the conjunctions of masculine and feminine names in the Roman
Pantheon &ldquo;do not represent <i>popular</i> ideas of the deities,
but ritualistic forms of invocation&rdquo; (p. 153). The answer is that
the popular mind is the matrix of mythology, and that if a State ritual
given to minimizing mythology recognized a given habit of myth-making
it was presumably abundant outside. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>short, the whole
academic process of reducing early Roman religion to something
unparalleled in anthropology is as ill-founded in the data as it is
repugnant to scientific thought.</p>
<p>The differentiation of Greek and Roman religion is to be explained
by the culture-history of the two peoples; and that, in turn, was
determined by their geographical situation and their special contacts.
Roman life was made systematically agricultural and militarist by its
initial circumstances, where Greek life in civilized Asia Minor became
industrial, artistic, and literary. The special &ldquo;genius&rdquo; of
Homer, or of various members of an order of bards developed by early
colonial-feudal Grecian conditions, would indeed count for much by
giving permanent artistic definiteness of form to the Greek Gods, where
the early Romans, leaving all the vocal arts mainly to the conservative
care of their women and children as something beneath adult male
notice, missed the utilization of poetic genius among them till they
were long past the period of romantic simplicity (cp. Mommsen, bk. i,
ch. 15; Eng. tr. 1894, vol. i, pp. 285&ndash;300). Hence the
<i>comparative</i> abstractness of their unsung Gods (cp. Schwegler,
<i lang="de">R&ouml;mische Geschichte</i>, i, 225&ndash;28, and refs.;
Boissier, <i lang="fr">La religion romaine</i>, as cited, i, 8), and
the absence of such a literary mythology as was evolved and preserved
in Greece by local patriotisms under the stimulus of the great epopees
and tragedies. The doctrine that &ldquo;<i>the</i> Italian is deficient
in the passion of the heart,&rdquo; and that <i>therefore</i>
&ldquo;Italian&rdquo; literature has &ldquo;never produced a true epos
or a genuine drama&rdquo; (Mommsen, ch. 15, vol. i, p. 284), is one of
a thousand samples of the fallacy of explaining a phenomenon in terms
of itself. Teuffel with equal futility affirms the contrary: &ldquo;Of
the various kinds of poetry, <i>dramatic poetry</i> seems after all to
be most in conformity with the character of the Roman people&rdquo; (as
cited, p. 3; cp. p. 28 as to the epos). On the same verbalist method,
Mommsen decides as to the Etruscan religion that &ldquo;the mysticism
and barbarism of their worship had their foundation in the essential
character of the Etruscan people&rdquo; (ch. 12, p. 232). Schwegler
gives a more objective view of the facts, but, like other German
writers whom he cites, errs in speaking of early deities like Picus as
&ldquo;only aspects of Mars,&rdquo; not realizing that Mars is merely
the surviving or developed deity of that type. He also commits the
conventional error of supposing that the early Roman religion is
fundamentally monotheistic or pantheistic, because the multitudinous
&ldquo;abstract&rdquo; deities are &ldquo;only&rdquo; aspects of the
general force of Nature. The notion that the Romans did not
anthropomorphize their deities like all other peoples is a surprising
fallacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus when Rome, advancing in the career of conquest, had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>developed a large aristocratic class, living a
city life, with leisure for intellectual interests, and had come in
continuous contact with the conquered Grecian cities of Southern Italy,
its educated men underwent a literary and a rationalistic influence at
the same time, and were the more ready to give up all practical belief
in their own slightly-defined Gods when they found Greeks explaining
away theirs. Here we see once more the primary historic process by
which men are led to realize the ill-founded character of their
hereditary creeds: the perception is indirectly set up by the
reflective recognition of the creeds of others, and all the more
readily when the others give a critical lead. Indeed, Greek rationalism
was already old when the Romans began to develop a written and artistic
literature: it had even taken on the popular form given to it by
Ev&ecirc;meros a century before the Romans took it up. Doubtless there
was skepticism among the latter before Ennius: such a piece of
religious procedure as the invention of a God of Silver (<i lang=
"la">Argentinus</i>), son of the God of Copper (<i lang=
"la">&AElig;sculanus</i>), on the introduction of a silver currency,
269 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, must have been smiled at by the more
intelligent.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11584src" href="#xd25e11584"

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Mommsen states (ii, 70) that at this epoch the Romans
kept &ldquo;equally aloof from superstition and unbelief,&rdquo; but
this is inaccurate on both sides. The narrative of Livy exhibits among
the people a boundless and habitual superstition. The records of absurd
prodigies of every sort so throng his pages that he himself repeatedly
ventures to make light of them. Talking oxen, skies on fire, showers of
flesh, crows and mice eating gold, rivers flowing blood, showers of
milk&mdash;such were the reports chronically made to the Roman
government by its pious subjects, and followed by anxious religious
ceremonies at Rome (cp. Livy, iii, 5, 10; x, 27; xi, 28&ndash;35; xxiv,
44; xxvii, 4, 11, 23, etc., etc. In the index to Drakenborch&rsquo;s
Livy there are over five columns of references to <i>prodigia</i>). On
the other hand, though superstition was certainly the rule, there are
traces of rationalism. On the next page after that cited, Mommsen
himself admits that the faith of the people had already been shaken by
the interference allowed to the priestly colleges in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>political matters; and in another chapter (bk.
ii, ch. 13; vol. ii, 112) he recalls that a consul of the Claudian gens
had jested openly at the auspices in the first Punic war, 249
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> The story is told by Cicero, <i lang=
"la">De natura Deorum</i>, ii, 3, and Suetonius, <i>Tiberius</i>, c. 2.
The sacred poultry, on being let out of their coop on board ship, would
not feed, so that the auspices could not be taken; whereupon the consul
caused them to be thrown into the water, <i lang="la">etiam per jocum
Deos inridens</i>, saying they might drink if they would not eat. His
colleague Junius in the same war also disregarded the auspices; and in
both cases, according to Balbus the Stoic in Cicero&rsquo;s treatise,
the Roman fleets were duly defeated; whereupon Claudius was condemned
by the people, and Junius committed suicide. Cp. Valerius Maximus, l.
i, c. iv, &sect; 3.</p>
<p>Such stories would fortify the age-long superstition as to auspices
and omens, which was in full force among Greek commanders as late as
Xenophon, when many cultured Greeks were rationalists. But it was
mainly a matter of routine, in a sphere where freethought is slow to
penetrate. There was probably no thought of jesting when, in the year
193 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, after men had grown weary alike of
earthquakes and of the religious services prescribed on account of
them; and after the consuls had been worn out by sacrifices and
expiations, it was decreed that &ldquo;if on any day a service had been
arranged for a reported earthquake, no one should report another on
that day&rdquo; (Livy, xxxiv, 55). Cato, who would never have dreamt of
departing from a Roman custom, was the author of the saying (Cicero,
<i lang="la">De Div.</i> ii, 24) that haruspices might well laugh in
each other&rsquo;s faces. He had in view the Etruscan practice, being
able to see the folly of that, though not of his own. Cp. Mommsen, iii,
116. As to the Etruscan origin of the haruspices, in distinction from
the augurs, see Schwegler, i, 276, 277; Ihne, Eng. ed. i, 82&ndash;83,
<i>note</i>; and O. M&uuml;ller as there cited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is with the translation of the <i>Sacred History</i> of
Ev&ecirc;meros by <span class="sc">Ennius</span>, about 200
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>, that the literary history of Roman
freethought begins. In view of the position of Ennius as a teacher of
Greek and <i lang="fr">belles lettres</i> (he being of Greek descent,
and born in Calabria), it cannot be supposed that he would openly
translate an anti-religious treatise without the general acquiescence
of his aristocratic patrons. Cicero says of him that he
&ldquo;followed&rdquo; as well as translated Ev&ecirc;meros;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e11644src" href="#xd25e11644" name=
"xd25e11644src">5</a> and his favourite Greek dramatists were the

translated.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11650src" href="#xd25e11650"

the traditional usages of official augury and ritual, it was in the
spirit of political conservatism that belonged to their class and their
civic ideal, and on the principle that religion was necessary for the
control of the multitude. In Etruria, where the old culture had run
largely to mysticism and soothsaying on quasi-oriental lines, the Roman
government took care to encourage it, by securing the theological
monopoly of the upper-class families,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11675src" href="#xd25e11675" name="xd25e11675src">8</a> and thus
set up a standing hot-bed of superstition. In the same spirit they
adopted from time to time popular cults from Greece, that of the
Phrygian Mother of the Gods being introduced in the year 204
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> The attempt (186 <span class=

distorted and extravagant account<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11691src"
href="#xd25e11691" name="xd25e11691src">9</a> is given by Livy, was
made on grounds of policy and not of religion; and even if the majority
of the senate had not been disposed to encourage the popular appetite
for emotional foreign worships, the multitude of their own accord would
have introduced the latter, in resentment of the exclusiveness of the
patricians in keeping the old domestic and national cults in their own
hands.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11708src" href="#xd25e11708" name=

of foreign slaves and residents in Rome, the foreign worships
multiplied with them; and with the worships came such forms of

religious conservatism for a time combined. In 173 <span class=

rhetors,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11720src" href="#xd25e11720" name=

<p class="first">While self-government lasted, rationalism among the
cultured classes was fairly common. The great poem of <span class=
"sc">Lucretius</span>, <i>On the Nature of Things</i>, with its
enthusiastic exposition of the doctrine of Epicurus, remains to show to
what a height of sincerity and ardour a Roman freethinker could rise.
No Greek utterance that has come down to us makes so direct and
forceful an attack as his on religion as a social institution. He is
practically the first systematic freethinking propagandist; so full is
he of his purpose that after his stately prologue to <i lang="la">alma
Venus</i>, who is for him but a personification of the genetic forces
of Nature, he plunges straight into his impeachment of religion as a
foul tyranny from which thinking men were first freed by Epicurus. The
sonorous verse vibrates with an indignation such as Shelley&rsquo;s in
<i>Queen Mab</i>: religion is figured as <i lang="la">horribili super
aspectu mortalibus instans</i>; a little further on its deeds are
denounced as <i lang="la">scelerosa atque impia</i>, &ldquo;wicked and
impious,&rdquo; the religious term being thus turned against itself;
and a moving picture of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia justifies the
whole. &ldquo;To so much of evil could religion persuade.&rdquo; It is
with a bitter consciousness of the fatal hold of the hated thing on
most men&rsquo;s ignorant imagination that he goes on to speak of the
fears<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11829src" href="#xd25e11829" name=
"xd25e11829src">20</a> so assiduously wrought upon by the <i lang=
"la">vates</i>, and to set up with strenuous speed the vividly-imagined
system of Epicurean science by which he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>seeks to fortify his
friend against them. That no thing comes from nothing, or lapses into
nothing; that matter is eternal; that all things proceed &ldquo;without
the Gods&rdquo; by unchanging law, are his insistent themes; and for
nigh two thousand years a religious world has listened with a reluctant
respect. His influence is admitted to have been higher and nobler than
that of the religion he assailed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Lucretius was the first not only to reveal a
new power, beauty, and mystery in the world, but also to communicate to
poetry a speculative impulse, opening up, with a more impassioned
appeal than philosophy can do, the great questions underlying human
life&mdash;such as the truth of all religious tradition, the position
of man in the universe, and the attitude of mind and course of conduct
demanded by that position.&rdquo; (Sellar, <i>Roman Poets of the
Republic: Virgil</i>, 1877, p. 199.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the eyes of Lucretius all worship seemed prompted by fear
and based on ignorance of natural law&#8202;&hellip;. But it is
nevertheless true that Lucretius was a great religious poet. He was a
prophet, in deadly earnest, calling men to renounce their errors both
of thought and conduct&#8202;&hellip;. We may be certain that he was
absolutely convinced of the truth of all that he wrote.&rdquo; (W.
Warde Fowler, <i>Social Life at Rome in the Age of Cicero</i>, 1909,
pp. 327&ndash;28.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet throughout the whole powerful poem we have testimony to the
pupillary character of Roman thought in relation to Grecian. However
much the earnest student may outgo his masters in emphasis and zeal of
utterance, he never transcends the original irrationality of asserting
that &ldquo;the Gods&rdquo; exist; albeit it is their glory to do
nothing. It is in picturing their ineffable peace that he reaches some
of his finest strains of song,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11853src"
href="#xd25e11853" name="xd25e11853src">21</a> though in the next
breath he repudiates every idea of their control of things cosmic or
human. He swears by their sacred breasts, <i lang="la">proh sancta deum
pectora</i>, and their life of tranquil joy, when he would express most
vehemently his scorn of the thought that it can be they who hurl the
lightnings which haply destroy their own temples and strike down alike
the just and the unjust. It is a survival of a quite primitive
conception of deity,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11859src" href=
"#xd25e11859" name="xd25e11859src">22</a> alongside of an advanced
anti-religious criticism.</p>
<p>The explanation of the anomaly seems to be twofold. In the first
place, Roman thought had not lived long enough&mdash;it never did live
long enough&mdash;to stand confidently on its own feet and criticize
its Greek teachers. In Cicero&rsquo;s treatise <i>On the Nature of the
Gods</i>, the Epicurean and the Stoic in turn retail their doctrine as
they had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>it from their school, the Epicurean affirming
the existence and the inaction of the Gods with equal confidence, and
repeating without a misgiving the formula about the Gods having not
bodies but quasi-bodies, with not blood but quasi-blood; the Stoic, who
stands by most of the old superstitions, professing to have his
philosophical reasons for them. Each sectarian derides the beliefs of
the other; neither can criticize his own creed. It would seem as if in
the habitually militarist society, even when it turns to philosophy,
there must prevail a militarist ethic and psychosis in the intellectual
life, each man choosing a flag or a leader and fighting through thick
and thin on that side henceforth. On the other hand, the argumentation
of the high-priest Cotta in the dialogue turns to similar purpose the
kindred principle of civic tradition. He argues in turn against the
Epicurean&rsquo;s science and the Stoic&rsquo;s superstition,
contesting alike the claim that the Gods are indifferent and the claim
that they govern; and in the end he brazenly affirms that, while he
sees no sound philosophic argument for religious beliefs and practices,
he thinks it is justifiable to maintain them on the score of
prescription or ancestral example. Here we have the senatorial or
conservative principle,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11872src" href=
"#xd25e11872" name="xd25e11872src">23</a> availing itself of the
skeptical dialectic of Carneades. In terms of that ideal, which
prevailed alike with believers and indifferentists,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e11884src" href="#xd25e11884" name="xd25e11884src">24</a> and
mediated between such rival schools as the Epicurean and Stoic, we may
partly explain the Epicurean theorem itself. For the rest, it is to be
understood as an outcome partly of surviving sentiment and partly of
forced compromise in the case of its Greek framers, and of the habit of
partizan loyalty in the case of its Roman adherents.</p>
<p>In the arguments of Cotta, the unbelieving high-priest, we
presumably have the doctrine of <span class="sc">Cicero</span>
himself,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11895src" href="#xd25e11895" name=
"xd25e11895src">25</a> who in the <i>Academica</i> avows his admiration
of Carneades&rsquo;s reasoning, and in the <i lang="la">De
Divinatione</i> follows it, but was anchored by officialism to State
usage. With his vacillating character, his forensic habit, and his
genius for mere speech, he could not but betray his own lack of
intellectual conviction; and such weakness as his found its natural
support in the principle of use and wont, the practice and tradition of
the commonwealth. On that footing he had it in him to boast
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>like any pedigreed patrician of the historic
religiousness of Rome, he himself the while being devoid of all
confident religious belief. His rhetoric on the subject can hardly be
otherwise estimated than as sheer hustings hypocrisy. Doubtless he gave
philosophic colour to his practice by noting the hopeless conflict of
the creeds of the positive sects, very much as in our own day
conservative dialectic finds a ground for religious conformity in the
miscarriages of the men of science.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11910src" href="#xd25e11910" name="xd25e11910src">26</a> But
Cicero does not seem even to have had a religious sentiment to cover
the nakedness of his political opportunism. Not only does he in the
<i>Tusculan Disputations</i> put aside in the Platonic fashion all the
Homeric tales which anthropomorphize and discredit the Gods;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e11921src" href="#xd25e11921" name=
"xd25e11921src">27</a> but in his treatise <i lang="la">On
Divination</i> he shows an absolute disbelief in all the recognized
practices, including the augury which he himself officially practised;
and his sole excuse is that they are to be retained &ldquo;on account
of popular opinion and of their great public utility.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e11929src" href="#xd25e11929" name=
"xd25e11929src">28</a> As to prodigies, he puts in germ the argument
later made famous by Hume: either the thing could happen (in the course

"#xd25e11952" name="xd25e11952src">31</a> Even the doctrine of
immortality, to which he repeatedly returns, seems to have been for
him, as for so many Christians since, only a forensic theme, never a
source of the private consolation he ascribed to it.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e11957src" href="#xd25e11957" name="xd25e11957src">32</a> In
Cicero&rsquo;s case, in fine, we reach the conclusion that either the
noted inconstancy of his character pervaded all his thinking, or that
his gift for mere utterance, and his demoralizing career as an
advocate, overbore in him all sincere reflection. But, indeed, the
practical subversion of all rational ethic in the public life of late
republican Rome, wherein men claimed to be free and self-governing, yet
lived by oppressing the rest of the world, was on all hands fatal to
the moral rectitude which inspires a critical philosophy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Modern scholarship still clings to the
long-established view that Cicero was practically right, and that
Lucretius was practically wrong. Augustus, says Dr. Warde Fowler, was
fortunate in finding in Virgil &ldquo;one who was in some sense a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>prophet as well as a poet, who could urge the
Roman by an imaginative example to return to a living <i lang=
"la">pietas</i>&mdash;not merely to the old religious forms, but to the
intelligent sense of duty to God and man which had built up his
character and his empire. In Cicero&rsquo;s day there was also a great
poet, he too in some sense a prophet; but Lucretius could only appeal
to the Roman to shake off the slough of his old religion, and such an
appeal was at the time both futile and dangerous. Looking at the matter
<i>historically, and not theologically</i>, we ought to sympathize with
the attitude of Cicero and Scaevola towards the religion of the State.
It was based on a statesmanlike instinct; and had it been possible for
that instinct to express itself practically in a positive policy like
that of Augustus, it is quite possible that much mischief might have
been averted&rdquo; (<i>Social Life at Rome</i>, pp. 325&ndash;26).</p>
<p>It is necessary to point out (1) that the early Roman&rsquo;s
&ldquo;sense of duty to God and man&rdquo; was never of a kind that
could fitly be termed &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;; and (2) that it was
his character that made his creed, and not his creed his character,
though creed once formed reacts on conduct. Further, it may be
permitted to suggest that we might consider historical problems
morally, and to deprecate the academic view that
&ldquo;statesmanship&rdquo; is something necessarily divorced from
veracity. The imperfect appeal of Lucretius to the spirit of truth in
an ignorant and piratical community, living an increasingly parasitic
life, was certainly &ldquo;futile&rdquo;; but it is a strange sociology
that sees in it something &ldquo;dangerous,&rdquo; while regarding the
life of perpetual conquest and plunder as a matter of course, and the
practice of systematic deceit as wholesome.</p>
<p>The summary of the situation is that Cicero&rsquo;s policy of
religious make-believe could no more have &ldquo;saved&rdquo; Rome than
Plato&rsquo;s could have saved Athens, or than that of Augustus
<i>did</i> save the empire. It went downhill about as steadily after as
before him; and it continued to do so under Christianity as under
paganism. The decline was absolutely involved in the policy of
universal conquest; and neither creeds nor criticism of creeds could
have &ldquo;averted&rdquo; the result while the cause subsisted. But
there is something gratuitously anti-rational in the thesis that such a
decay might have been prevented by a politic manipulation of beliefs
<i>known</i> to be false, and that some regeneration was really worked
in Rome by the tale of pious &AElig;neas. In his <i>Religious
Experience of the Roman People</i> (1911) Dr. Fowler is more
circumspect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the upper-class Rome of Cicero&rsquo;s day his type seems to have
been predominant,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11990src" href=
"#xd25e11990" name="xd25e11990src">33</a> the women alone being in the

"#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>and in their case the tendency was
to add new superstitions to the old. Among public men there subsisted a
clear understanding that public religion should continue for reasons of
State. When we find an eminent politician like the elder M.
&AElig;milius Scaurus prosecuted in the year 103 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> on a charge of neglecting certain religious ceremonies
connected with his offices, we know that there had been neither
conscientious abstention on his part nor sincere religious resentment
on the other side, but merely a resort by political enemies, after
Greek precedent, to a popular means of blackening an antagonist; for
the same Scaurus, who was a member of the college of augurs, had
actually rebuilt or restored the temple of Fides, said to have been
founded by Numa, and that of Mens (Prudence), which had been set up
after the great defeat of the Romans at the Trasimene lake;<a class=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Dean Merivale, noting that C&aelig;sar
&ldquo;professed without reserve the principles of the
unbelievers,&rdquo; observes that, &ldquo;freethinker as he was, he
could not escape from the universal thraldom of superstition in which
his contemporaries were held&rdquo; (<i>Hist. of the Romans under the
Empire</i>, ed. 1865, ii, 424). The reproach, from a priest, is
piquant, but misleading. All the stories on which it is founded apply
to the last two or three years of C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s life; and
supposing them to be all true, which is very doubtful, they would but
prove what has been suggested above&mdash;that the overstrained
soldier, rising to the dizzy height of a tremendous career, partly lost
his mental balance, like so many another. (Cp. Mackail, <i>Latin
Literature</i>, 1895, p. 80.) Such is the bearing of the doubtful story
(Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat.</i> xxviii, 2) that after the breaking down of a
chariot (presumably the casualty which took place in his fourfold
triumph; see Dio Cassius, xlviii, 21) he never mounted another without
muttering a charm. M. Boissier (i, 70) makes the statement of Pliny
apply to C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s whole life; but although Pliny gives no
particulars, even Dean Merivale (p. 372) connects it with the accident
in the triumph. To the same time belongs the less challengeable record
(Dio Cassius, lx, 23) of his climbing on his knees up the steps of the
Capitol to propitiate Nemesis. The very questionable legend, applied so
often to other captains, of his saying, <i>I have thee, Africa</i>,
when he stumbled on landing (Sueton. <i>Jul.</i> 59), is a proof not of
superstition but of presence of mind in checking the superstitious
fears of the troops, and was so understood by Suetonius; as was the
rather flimsy story of his taking with him in Africa a man nicknamed
Salutio (Sueton. <i>ibid.</i>) to neutralize the luck of the opposing
Cornelii. The whole turn given to the details by the clerical historian
is arbitrary and unjudicial. Nor is he accurate in saying that
C&aelig;sar &ldquo;denied the Gods&rdquo; in the Senate. He actually
swore by them, <i lang="la">per Deos immortales</i>, in the next
sentence to that in which he denied a future state. The assertion of
the historian (p. 423), that in denying the immortality of the soul
C&aelig;sar denied &ldquo;the recognized foundation of all
religion,&rdquo; is a no less surprising error. The doctrine never had
been so recognized in ancient Rome. A Christian ecclesiastic might have
been expected to remember that the Jewish religion, believed by him to
be divine, was devoid of the &ldquo;recognized foundation&rdquo; in
question, and that the canonical book of Ecclesiastes expressly
discards it. Of course C&aelig;sar offered sacrifices to Gods in whom
he did not believe. That was the habitual procedure of his age.</p>

<p class="first">It is significant that the decay of rationalism in
Rome begins and proceeds with the Empire. Augustus, whose chosen name
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>sacerdotal in its character,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e12096src" href="#xd25e12096" name="xd25e12096src">42</a> made
it part of his policy to restore as far as possible the ancient cults,
many of which had fallen into extreme neglect, between the indifference
of the aristocratic class<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12099src" href=
"#xd25e12099" name="xd25e12099src">43</a> and the devotion of the
populace, itself so largely alien, to the more attractive worships
introduced from Egypt and the East. That he was himself a habitually
superstitious man seems certain;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12108src"
href="#xd25e12108" name="xd25e12108src">44</a> but even had he not
been, his policy would have been natural from the Roman point of view.
A historian of two centuries later puts in the mouth of M&aelig;cenas
an imagined counsel to the young emperor to venerate and enforce the
national religion, to exclude and persecute foreign cults, to put down
alike atheism and magic, to control divination officially, and to keep
an eye on the philosophers.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12117src" href=
"#xd25e12117" name="xd25e12117src">45</a> What the empire sought above
all things was stability; and a regimen of religion, under imperial
control, seemed one of the likeliest ways to keep the people docile.
Julius himself had seemed to plan such a policy,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12121src" href="#xd25e12121" name="xd25e12121src">46</a> though
he also planned to establish public libraries,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12126src" href="#xd25e12126" name="xd25e12126src">47</a> which
would hardly have promoted faith among the educated.</p>
<p>Augustus, however, aimed at encouraging public religion of every
description, repairing or rebuilding eighty-two temples at Rome alone,
giving them rich gifts, restoring old festivals and ceremonies,
reinstituting priestly colleges, encouraging special foreign worships,
and setting up new civic cults; himself playing high pontiff and
joining each new priesthood, to the end of making his power and
prestige so far identical with theirs;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12137src" href="#xd25e12137" name="xd25e12137src">48</a> in
brief, anticipating the later ruling principle of the Church of Rome.
The natural upshot of the whole process was the imperial apotheosis, or
raising of each emperor to Godhead at death. The usage of deifying
living rulers was long before common in Egypt and the east,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e12143src" href="#xd25e12143" name=
"xd25e12143src">49</a> and had been adopted by the conquering Spartan
Lysander in Asia Minor as readily as by the conquering Alexander.
Julius C&aelig;sar seems to have put it aside as a nauseous
flattery;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12152src" href="#xd25e12152" name=
"xd25e12152src">50</a> but Augustus wrought it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>into
his policy. It was the consummation at once of the old political
conception of religion and of the new autocracy.</p>
<p>In a society so managed, all hope of return to self-government
having ceased, the level of thought sank accordingly. There was
practically no more active freethought. Livy, indeed, speaks so often
of the contempt shown in his own day for tales of prodigies, and of
what he calls contempt for the Gods,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12166src" href="#xd25e12166" name="xd25e12166src">51</a> that
there can be no question of the lack of religion among the upper
classes at the beginning of the empire. But even in Livy&rsquo;s day
unbelief had ceased to go beyond a shrugging of the shoulders.
<span class="sc">Horace</span>, with his <i lang="la">credat

environment.</p>
<p>As the empire proceeds, the echoes of the old freethought become
fewer and fewer. It is an entire misconception to suppose that
Christianity came into the Roman world as a saving counter-force to
licentious unbelief. Unbelief had in large part disappeared before
Christianity made any headway; and that creed came as one of many
popular cults, succeeding in terms of its various adaptations to the
special conditions, moral and economic. It was easy for the populace of
the empire to deify a ruler: as easy as for those of the East to deify
Jesus; or for the early Romans to deify Romulus; at Rome it was the
people, now so largely of alien stock, who had most insisted on
deifying C&aelig;sar.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12268src" href=
"#xd25e12268" name="xd25e12268src">64</a> But the upper class soon kept
pace with them in the zest for religion. In the first century, the
elder <span class="sc">Pliny</span> recalls the spirit of Lucretius by
the indignant eloquence with which he protests against the burdensome
belief in immortality;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12277src" href=
"#xd25e12277" name="xd25e12277src">65</a> and the emphasis with which
he scouts alike the polytheism of the multitude, the universal worship
of Fortune, and the idea that man can know the infinite divinity which
is the universe;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12283src" href=
"#xd25e12283" name="xd25e12283src">66</a> but, though Seneca and others
reject the fear of future torment, Pliny is the last writer to
repudiate with energy the idea of a future state.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12294src" href="#xd25e12294" name="xd25e12294src">67</a> A number
of epitaphs still chime with his view; but already the majority are on
the other side;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12300src" href="#xd25e12300"
name="xd25e12300src">68</a> and the fear of hell was normally as active
as the hope of heaven; while the belief in an approaching end of the
world was proportionally as common as it was later under
Christianity.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12305src" href="#xd25e12305"
name="xd25e12305src">69</a> And though Pliny, discussing the bases of
magic, of which he recognized the fraudulence, ranks among them the
influences of religion, as to which he declared mankind to be still in
extreme darkness,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12311src" href=
"#xd25e12311" name="xd25e12311src">70</a> we have seen how he in turn,

stars.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12320src" href="#xd25e12320" name=
"xd25e12320src">71</a> Thus, whatever may be the truth as to the
persecutions of the Christians in the first two centuries of the
empire, the motive was in all cases certainly political or moral, as in
the earlier case of the Bacchic mysteries, not rationalistic hostility
to its doctrines as apart from Christian attacks on the established
worships. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some unbelievers there doubtless were after <span class=
"sc">Petronius</span>, whose perdurable maxim that &ldquo;Fear first
made Gods in the world,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12329src"
href="#xd25e12329" name="xd25e12329src">72</a> adopted in the next

"xd25e12340src" href="#xd25e12340" name="xd25e12340src">73</a> was too
pregnant with truth to miss all acceptance among thinking men. The fact
that Statius in his verse ranked Domitian with the Gods made its truth
none the less pointed. The Alexandrian rationalist <span class=
"sc">Chaeremon</span>, who had been appointed one of the tutors of
Nero, had explained the Egyptian religion as a mere allegorizing of the
physical order of the universe.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12349src"
href="#xd25e12349" name="xd25e12349src">74</a> It has been remarked too
that in the next century the appointment of the freethinking Greek
Lucian by Marcus Aurelius to a post of high authority in Egypt showed
that his writings gave no great offence at court,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12358src" href="#xd25e12358" name="xd25e12358src">75</a> where,
indeed, save under the two great Antonines, religious seriousness was
rare. These, however, were the exceptions: the whole cast of mind
developed under the autocracy, whether in the good or in the bad, made
for belief and acquiescence or superstition rather than for searching
doubt and sustained reasoning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The statement of Mosheim or of his commentators
(<i>Eccles. Hist.</i> 1 Cent. Pt. I, ch. i, &sect; 21, <i>note</i>;
Murdock&rsquo;s trans. Reid&rsquo;s ed.) that <span class=
"sc">Juvenal</span> (Sat. xiii, 86) &ldquo;complains of the many
atheists at Rome&rdquo; is a perversion of the passage cited.
Juvenal&rsquo;s allusion to those who put all things down to fortune
and deny a moral government of the world begins with the phrase
&ldquo;<i lang="la">sunt qui</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;there are (those)
who&rdquo;; he makes far more account of the many superstitious, and
never suggests that the atheists are numerous in his day. Neither does
he &ldquo;complain&rdquo;; on the contrary, his allusion to the
atheists as such is non-condemnatory as compared with his attacks on
pious rogues, and is thus part of the ground for holding that he was
himself something of a freethinker&mdash;one of the last among the
literary men. In the tenth Satire (346 <i>sqq.</i>) he puts the
slightly theistic doctrine, sometimes highly praised (ed. Ruperti,
1817, <i lang="la">in loc.</i>), that men should not pray for anything,
but leave the decision to the Gods, to whom man is dearer than to
himself. There too occurs the famous doctrine (356) that if anything is
to be prayed for it should be the <i lang="la">mens sana in corpore
sano</i>, and the strong soul void of the fear of death. The
accompanying phrase about offering &ldquo;the intestines and the sacred
sausages of a whitish pig&rdquo; is flatly contemptuous of religious
ceremonial; and the closing lines, placing the source <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>of
virtue and happiness within, are strictly naturalistic. In the two
last:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Nullum numen habes, si sit prudentia; nos [<i lang=
"en">or</i> sed] te</p>
<p class="line">Nos facimus, Fortuna, Deam, c&oelig;loque locamus,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">the frequent reading <i lang="la">abest</i> for
<i lang="la">habes</i> seems to make the better sense: &ldquo;No
divinity is wanting, if there be prudence; but it is we, O fortune, who
make thee a Goddess, and throne thee in heaven.&rdquo; In any case, the
insistence is on man&rsquo;s lordship of himself. (The phrase occurs
again in <i>Sat.</i> xiv, 315.) But the worship of Fortune&mdash;which
Pliny declares to be the prevailing faith of his day (<i>Hist. Nat.</i>
II, v (vii), 7<span class="corr" id="xd25e12414" title=
"Not in source">)</span>&mdash;was itself a cult like another, with
temples and ritual; and the astrology which, he adds, is beginning to
supersede Fortune-worship among the learned and the ignorant alike, was
but a reversion to an older Eastern religion. His own preference is for
sun-worship, if any; but he falls back on the conviction that the power
of God is limited, and that God is thus seen to be simply Nature
(<i>id.</i> 8).</p>
<p>The erroneous notion that the Roman aristocracy ran mainly to
atheism was widely propagated by Voltaire, who made it part of his
argument against the atheism of his own day (<i>Jenni</i>; art.
<i lang="fr">Ath&eacute;isme</i>, in the <i lang="fr">Dict.
Philos.</i>, etc.). It will not bear examination. As regards the
general tone of Roman literature from the first century onwards, the
summing-up of Renan is substantially just: &ldquo;The freethinkers
&hellip; diminish little by little, and disappear&#8202;&hellip;.
Juvenal alone continues in Roman society, down to the time of Hadrian,
the expression of a frank incredulity&#8202;&hellip;. Science dies out
from day to day. From the death of Seneca, it may be said that there is
no longer a thoroughly rationalistic scholar. Pliny the Elder is
inquisitive, but uncritical. Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, Suetonius,
avoid commenting on the inanity of the most ridiculous inventions.
Pliny the Younger (Ep. vii, 27) believes in puerile stories of ghosts;
Epictetus (xxxi, 5) would have all practise the established worship.
Even a writer so frivolous as Apuleius feels himself bound to take the
tone of a rigid conservative about the Gods (<i>Florida</i>, i, 1;
<i>De Magia</i>, 41, 55, 56, 63). A single man, about the middle of
this century, seems entirely exempt from supernatural beliefs; that is
Lucian. The scientific spirit, which is the negation of the
supernatural, exists only in a few; superstition invades all,
enfeebling all reason&rdquo; (<i lang="fr">Les &Eacute;vangiles</i>,
ed. 1877, pp. 406&ndash;407).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the mental paralysis connects causally with the political
conditions will perhaps not now be denied. A censorship of the written
word belongs congenitally to autocracy; and only the personal
magnanimity of C&aelig;sar and the prudence of Augustus delayed its
development in Rome. Soon it became an irresistible terrorism. Even
C&aelig;sar, indeed, so far forgot one of the great rules <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>of
his life as to impeach before the Senate the tribunes who had quite
justifiably prosecuted some of the people who had hailed him as
king;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12447src" href="#xd25e12447" name=
"xd25e12447src">76</a> and the fact that the Senate was already slavish
enough to eject them gives the forecast of the future. Augustus long
showed a notable forbearance to all manner of verbal opposition, and
even disparagement; but at length he also began to prosecute for
private aspersions,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12458src" href=
"#xd25e12458" name="xd25e12458src">77</a> and even to suppress
histories of a too critical stamp. Tiberius began his reign with the
high-pitched sentiment that &ldquo;in a free State tongue and mind
should be free&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12461src" href=
"#xd25e12461" name="xd25e12461src">78</a> and for a time he bore
himself with an exemplary restraint; but he too, in turn, took the
colour of his place, and became murderously resentful of any semblance
of aspersion on himself.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12467src" href=
"#xd25e12467" name="xd25e12467src">79</a> The famous sentiment ascribed
to him in the <i>Annals</i> of Tacitus, <i lang="la">Deorum injuriae
diis curae</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e12478src" href="#xd25e12478"
name="xd25e12478src">80</a>&mdash;&ldquo;the Gods&rsquo; wrongs are the
Gods&rsquo; business&rdquo;&mdash;is not noted by Suetonius, and has an
un-Roman sound. What Suetonius tells is<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12483src" href="#xd25e12483" name="xd25e12483src">81</a> that he
was &ldquo;very negligent concerning the Gods and religions,&rdquo; yet
addicted to the astrologers, and a believer in fate. The fact remains
that while, as aforesaid, there must have been still a number of
unbelievers, there is no sign after Lucretius of any Roman propaganda
against religion; and the presumption is that the Augustan policy of
promoting the old cults was extended to the maintenance of the ordinary
Roman view that disrespect to the Gods was a danger to the State. In
the reign of Nero we find trace of a treatise <i lang="la">De
religionis erroribus</i> by Fabricius Vejento,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12491src" href="#xd25e12491" name="xd25e12491src">82</a> wherein
was ridiculed the zeal of the priests to proclaim mysteries which they
did not understand; but, whether or not its author was exiled and the
book burnt on their protest, such literature was not further
produced.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12500src" href="#xd25e12500" name=
"xd25e12500src">83</a></p>
<p>There was, in fact, no spirit left for a Lucretian polemic against
false beliefs. Everything in the nature of a searching criticism of
life was menaced by the autocracy; Nero decreeing that no man should
philosophize at Rome,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12508src" href=
"#xd25e12508" name="xd25e12508src">84</a> after slaying or banishing a

they were disabled for any disinterested warfare on behalf of truth.
All serious impeachment of religion proceeds upon an ethical motive;
and in imperial Rome there was no room for any nobility of ethic save
such as upbore the Stoics in their austere pursuit of self-control, in
a world too full of evil to be delighted in.</p>
<p>Thus it came about that the C&aelig;sars, who would doubtless have
protected their co-operating priesthoods from any serious attack on the
official religion,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12527src" href=
"#xd25e12527" name="xd25e12527src">87</a> had practically no occasion
to do so. Lucian&rsquo;s jests were cast at the Gods of Greece, not at
those of the Roman official cults; hence his immunity. What the
C&aelig;sars were concerned to do was rather to menace any alien
religion that seemed to undermine the solidarity of the State; and of
such religions, first the Jewish, and later the Christian, were obvious
examples. Thus we have it that Tiberius &ldquo;put down foreign
religions&rdquo; (<i lang="la">externas ceremonias</i>), in particular
the Egyptian and Judaic rites; pulling down the temple of Isis,
crucifying her priests, expelling from Rome all Jews and proselytes,
and forcing the Jewish youth to undergo military service in unhealthy
climates.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12533src" href="#xd25e12533" name=
"xd25e12533src">88</a> Even the astrologers, in whose lore he believed,
he expelled until they promised to renounce their art&mdash;a precedent
partly set up by Augustus,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12542src" href=
"#xd25e12542" name="xd25e12542src">89</a> and followed with varying
severity by all the emperors, pagan and Christian alike.</p>
<p>And still the old Italian religion waned, as it must. On the one
hand, the Italic population was almost wholly replaced or diluted by
alien stocks, slave or free, with alien cults and customs; on the
other, the utter insincerity of the official cults, punctiliously
conserved by well-paid, unbelieving priests, invited indifference. In
the nature of things, an unchanging creed is moribund; life means
adaptation to change; and it was only the alien cults that in Rome
adapted themselves to the psychic mutation. Among the educated, who had
read their Lucretius, the spectacle of the innumerable cults of the
empire conduced either to entire but tacit unbelief, or to a species of
vaguely rationalistic<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12551src" href=
"#xd25e12551" name="xd25e12551src">90</a> yet sentimental monotheism,

<p class="first">One element of betterment there was in the life of
declining Rome, until the Roman ideals were superseded by oriental.
Even the Augustan poets, Horace and Ovid, had protested like the Hebrew
prophets, and like Plato and like Cicero, against the idea that rich
sacrifices availed with the Gods above a pure heart; and such doctrine,
while paganism lasted, prevailed more and more.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12567src" href="#xd25e12567" name="xd25e12567src">92</a> At the
same time, Horace rejects the Jud&aelig;o-Stoic doctrine, adopted in
the gospels, that all sins are equal, and lays down the rational moral
test of utility&mdash;<i lang="la">Utilitas justi prop&egrave; mater et
aequi</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12598src" href="#xd25e12598"
name="xd25e12598src">93</a> The better and more thoughtful men who grew
up under the autocracy, though inevitably feebler and more credulous in
their thinking than those of the later commonwealth, developed at
length a concern for conduct, public and private, which lends dignity
to the later philosophic literature, and lustre to the imperial rule of
the Antonines. This concern it was that, linking Greek theory to Roman
practice, produced a code of rational law which could serve Europe for
a thousand years. This concern too it was, joined with the relatively
high moral quality of their theism, that ennobled the writing of
Seneca<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12616src" href="#xd25e12616" name=
"xd25e12616src">94</a> and Epictetus and Maximus of Tyre; and
irradiates the words as well as the rule of Marcus Aurelius. In them
was anticipated all that was good<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12628src"
href="#xd25e12628" name="xd25e12628src">95</a> in the later Christian
ethic, even as the popular faiths anticipated the Christian dogmas; and
they cherished a temper of serenity that the Fathers fell far short of.
To compare their pages with those of the subsequent Christian
Fathers&mdash;Seneca with Lactantius, &ldquo;the Christian
Cicero&rdquo;; Maximus with Arnobius; Epictetus with Tertullian; the
admirable Marcus, and his ideal of the &ldquo;dear city of Zeus,&rdquo;
with the shrill polemic of Augustine&rsquo;s <i>City of God</i> and the
hysteria of the <i>Confessions</i>&mdash;is to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>prove a rapid descent in magnanimity, sanity,
self-command, sweetness of spirit, and tolerance. What figures as
religious intolerance in the C&aelig;sars was, as we have seen, always
a political, never a religious, animosity. Any prosecution of
Christians under the Antonines was certainly on the score of breach of
law, turbulence, or real or supposed malpractices, not on that of
heresy&mdash;a crime created only by the Christians themselves, in
their own conflicts.</p>
<p>The scientific account of the repellent characteristics of the
Fathers, of course, is not that their faith made them what they were,
but that the ever-worsening social and intellectual conditions assorted
such types into their ecclesiastical places, and secured for them their
influence over the types now prevailing among the people. They too
stand for the intellectual dissolution wrought by imperialism. When all
the higher forms of intellectual efficiency were at an end, it was
impossible that on any religious impulse whatever there should be
generated either a higher code of life or a saner body of thought than
those of the higher paganism of the past. Their very arguments against
paganism are largely drawn from old &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; sources. Those
who still speak of the rise of Christianity in the ancient world as a
process of &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; are merely turning historical
science out of doors. The Christian Fathers had all the opportunity
that a life of quasi-intellectual specialism could supply; and their
liberty of criticism as regarded the moribund pagan creeds was a
further gymnastic; but nothing could countervail the insanity of their
intellectual presuppositions, which they could not transcend.</p>
<p>Inheriting the Judaic hypnotism of the Sacred Book, they could
reason only as do railers; and the moral readjustment which put them in
revolt against the erotic element in pagan mythology was a mere
substitution of an ascetic neurosis for the old disease of imagination.
Strictly speaking, their asceticism, being never rationalized, never
rose to the level of ethic as distinguished from mere taboo or
sacrosanct custom. As we shall see, they could not wholly escape the
insurgence of the spirit of reason; but they collectively scouted it
with a success attained by no other ostensibly educated priesthood of
antiquity. They intellectually represent, in fact, the consummation of
the general Mediterranean decadence.</p>
<p>For the rest, the &ldquo;triumph&rdquo; of the new faith was simply
the survival of the forms of thought, and, above all, of the form of
religious community, best fitted to the political and intellectual
environment. The new Church organization was above all things a great
economic endowment for a class of preachers, polemists, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>propagandists; and between the closing of the
old spheres of public life and the opening of the new,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e12651src" href="#xd25e12651" name=
"xd25e12651src">96</a> the new faith was established as much by
political and economic conditions as by its intellectual adaptation to
an age of mental twilight.</p>
<p>Of the religion of the educated pagans in its last forms, then, it
is finally to be said that it was markedly rationalistic as compared
with the Christianity which followed, and has been on that ground
stigmatized by Christian orthodoxy down till our own day. The religion
of Marcus Aurelius is self-reverence, self-study, self-rule,
<i>plus</i> faith in Deity; and it is not to be gainsaid that, next to
his adoptive father Antoninus Pius, he remains the noblest monarch in
ancient history; the nearest parallel being the more superstitious but
still noble Julian, the last of the great pagan rulers. In such rulers
the antique philosophy was in a measure justified of its children; and
if it never taught them to grapple with the vast sociological problem
set up by the Empire, and so failed to preserve the antique
civilization, it at least did as much for them in that regard as the
new faith did for its followers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218"

Mommsen, <i>History of Rome</i>, bk. i, ch. 14 (Eng. tr. 1894, vol. i,

Mommsen, bk. ii, ch. 8. Eng. tr. ii, 70. Such creation of deities by
mere abstraction of things and functions had been the rule in the
popular as distinguished from the civic religion. Cp. Augustine,
<i lang="la">De civitate Dei</i>, iv, 16, 23; vi, 9, etc. It was the
concomitant of the tendency noted by Livy: <i lang="la">adeo minimis
etiam rebus prava religio inserit deos</i> (xxvii, 23). But the
practice was not peculiar to the Romans, for among the Greeks were Gods
or Goddesses of Wealth, Peace, Mercy, Shame, Fortune, Rumour, Energy,
Action, Persuasion, Consolation, Desire, Yearning, Necessity, Force,
etc. See Pausanias <i>passim</i>. The inference is that the more
specific deities in all religions, with personal names, are the product
of sacerdotal institutions or of poetic or other art. M. Boissier (i,
5), like Ihne, takes it for granted that the multitude of deified
abstractions had no legends; but this is unwarranted. They may have had
many; but there were no poets to sing, or priests to preserve and
ritualize them.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

justify his course, which was a bad lapse of judgment, even if the
suspicion were just. From this point a conspiracy against his life was
natural. Cp. Long, <i>Decline of the Roman Republic</i>, v,

<p class="first">The Christian gospels, broadly considered, stand for a
certain measure of freethinking reaction against the Jewish religion,
and are accordingly to be reckoned with in the present inquiry; albeit
their practical outcome was only an addition to the world&rsquo;s
supernaturalism and traditional dogma. To estimate aright their share
of freethought, we have but to consider the kind and degree of demand
they made on the reason of the ancient listener, as apart, that is,
from the demand made on their basis for the recognition of a new Deity.
When this is done it will be found that they express in parts a process
of reflection which outwent even critical common sense in a kind of
ecstatic Stoicism, an oriental repudiation of the tyranny of passions
and appetites; in other parts a mysticism that proceeds as far beyond
the credulity of ordinary faith. Socially considered, they embody a
similar opposition between an anarchistic and a partly orthodox or
regulative ideal. The plain inference is that they stand for many
independent movements of thought in the Gr&aelig;co-Roman world. It is
actually on record that the reduction of the whole law to love of
one&rsquo;s neighbour<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12674src" href=
"#xd25e12674" name="xd25e12674src">1</a> was taught before the
Christian era by the famous Rabbi Hillel;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12682src" href="#xd25e12682" name="xd25e12682src">2</a> and the
gospel itself<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12688src" href="#xd25e12688"
name="xd25e12688src">3</a> shows that this view was current. In another
passage<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12693src" href="#xd25e12693" name=
"xd25e12693src">4</a> the reduction of the ten commandments to five
again indicates a not uncommon disregard for the ecclesiastical side of
the law. But the difference between the two passages points of itself
to various forces of relative freethought.</p>
<p>Any attentive study of the gospels discloses not merely much
glossing and piecing and interpolating of documents, but a plain medley
of doctrines, of ideals, of principles; and to accept the mass of
disconnected utterances ascribed to &ldquo;the Lord,&rdquo; many of
them associated with miracles, as the oral teaching of any one man, is
a proceeding so uncritical that in no other study could it now be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>followed. The simple fact that the Pauline
Epistles (by whomsoever written) show no knowledge of any Jesuine
miracles or teachings whatever, except as regards the Last Supper
(<a class="biblink xd25e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2011:24-25&amp;version=NRSV">1
Cor. xi, 24&ndash;25</a>&mdash;a passage obviously interpolated),
admits of only three possible interpretations: (1) the Jesus then
believed in had not figured as a teacher at all; <i>or</i> (2) the
writer or writers gave no credit or attached no importance to reports
of his teachings. Either of these views (of which the first is plainly
the more plausible) admits of (3) the further conclusion that the
Pauline Jesus was not the Gospel Jesus, but an earlier one&mdash;a fair
enough hypothesis; but on that view the mass of Dominical utterances in
the gospels is only so much the less certificated. When, then, it is
admitted by all open-minded students that the <i>events</i> in the
narrative are in many cases fictitious, even when they are not
miraculous, it is wholly inadmissible that the <i>sayings</i> should be
trustworthy, as one man&rsquo;s teachings.</p>
<p>Analysing them in collation, we find even in the Synoptics, and
without taking into account the Fourth Gospel, such wide discrepancies
as the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">1. The doctrine: &ldquo;the Kingdom of God is among

<p>Such variously serious discrepancies count for more than even the
chronological and other divergences of the records concerning the
Birth, the Supper, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection, as proofs of
diversity of source; and they may be multiplied indefinitely. The only
course for criticism is to admit that they stand for the ideas of a
variety of sects or movements, or else for an unlimited manipulation of
the documents by individual hands. Many of them may very well have come
from various so-called &ldquo;Lords&rdquo; and &ldquo;Messiahs&rdquo;;
but they cannot be from a single teacher.</p>
<p>There remains open the fascinating problem as to whether some if not
all of the more notable teachings may not be the utterances of one
teacher of commanding originality, whose sectaries were either unable
to appreciate or unable to keep separate his doctrine.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e12944src" href="#xd25e12944" name=
"xd25e12944src">5</a> Undoubtedly some of the better teachings came
first from men of superior capacity and relatively deep ethical
experience. The veto on revenge, and the inculcation of love to
enemies, could not come from commonplace minds; and the saying
preserved from the <i>Gospel According to the Hebrews</i>,
&ldquo;Unless ye cease from sacrificing the wrath shall not cease from
you,&rdquo; has a remarkable ring.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12953src"
href="#xd25e12953" name="xd25e12953src">6</a> But <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>when
we compare the precept of forgiveness with similar teachings in the
Hebrew books and the Talmud,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12961src" href=
"#xd25e12961" name="xd25e12961src">7</a> we realize that the capacity
for such thought had been shown by a number of Jewish teachers, and
that it was a specific result of the long sequence of wrong and
oppression undergone by the Jewish people at the hands of their
conquerors. The unbearable, consuming pain of an impotent hate, and the
spectacle of it in others&mdash;this experience among thoughtful men,
and not an unconditioned genius for ethic in one, is the source of a
teaching which, categorically put as it is in the gospels, misses its
meaning with most who profess to admire it; the proof being the entire
failure of most Christians in all ages to act on it. To say nothing of
similar teaching in Old Testament books and in the Talmud, we have it
in the most emphatic form in the pre-Christian &ldquo;Slavonic
Enoch.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12968src" href="#xd25e12968"
name="xd25e12968src">8</a></p>
<p>A superior ethic, then, stands not for one man&rsquo;s supernormal
insight, but for the acquired wisdom of a number of wise men. And it is
now utterly impossible to name the individual framers of the gospel
teachings, good or bad. The central biography dissolves at every point
before critical tests; it is a mythical construction.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e12975src" href="#xd25e12975" name="xd25e12975src">9</a> Of the
ideas in the Sermon on the Mount, many are ancient; of the parabolic
and other teachings, some of the most striking occur only in the third
gospel, and are unquestionably late. And when we are asked to recognize
a unique personality behind any one doctrine, such as the condemnation
of sacrifice in the uncanonical Hebrew Gospel, we can but answer (1)
that on the face of the case this doctrine appears to come from a
separate circle; (2) that the renunciation of sacrifice was made by
many Greek and Roman writers,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12981src"
href="#xd25e12981" name="xd25e12981src">10</a> and by earlier teachers
among the Hebrews;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12984src" href=
"#xd25e12984" name="xd25e12984src">11</a> and (3) that in the Talmud,
and in such a pre-Christian document as the &ldquo;Slavonic
Enoch,&rdquo; there are teachings which, had they occurred in the
gospels, would have been confidently cited as unparalleled in ancient
literature. The Talmudic teachings, so vitally necessary in Jewry, that
&ldquo;it is better to be persecuted than persecutor,&rdquo; and that,
&ldquo;were the persecutor a just man and the persecuted an impious,
God would still be on the side of the persecuted,&rdquo;<a class=

&ldquo;Blessed is he who looks to raise his own hand for
labour,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13006src" href="#xd25e13006"
name="xd25e13006src">13</a> is no less remarkable. But it is impossible
to associate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>these teachings with any outstanding
personality, or any specific movements; and to posit a movement-making
personality in the sole case of certain scattered sayings in the
gospels is critically inadmissible.</p>
<p>There is positively no ground for supposing that any selected set of
teachings constituted the basis or the original propaganda of any
single Christian sect, primary or secondary; and the whole known
history of the cult tells against the hypothesis that it ever centred
round those teachings which to-day specially appeal to the ethical
rationalist. Such teachings are more likely to be adventitious than
fundamental, in a cult of sacrificial salvation. When an essentially
rationalistic note is struck in the gospels, as in the
insistence<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13014src" href="#xd25e13014"
name="xd25e13014src">14</a> that a notable public catastrophe is not to
be regarded in the old Jewish manner as a punishment for sin, it is
cancelled in the next sentence by an interpolation which
unintelligently reaffirms the very doctrine denied.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e13019src" href="#xd25e13019" name="xd25e13019src">15</a> So
with the teaching<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13025src" href=
"#xd25e13025" name="xd25e13025src">16</a> that the coming worship is to
be neither Judaic nor Samaritan: the next sentence reaffirms Jewish
particularism in the crudest way. The main movement, then, was clearly
superstitious.</p>
<p>It remains to note the so-far rationalistic character of such
teachings as the protests against ceremonialism and sabbatarianism, the
favouring of the poor and the outcast, the extension of the future life
to non-Israelites, and the express limitation of prayer (<a class=

Lk. xi, 3</a>) is pointless and tautological as it stands in the
English and other Protestant versions. In verse 8 is the assurance that
the Father knows beforehand what is needed; the prayer is, therefore,
to be a simple process of communion or advocation, free of all
verbiage; then, to make it specially ask for the necessary subsistence,
without which life would cease, and further to make the demand each
day, when in the majority of cases there would be no need to offer such
a request, is to stultify the whole. If the most obvious necessity is
to be urged, why not all the less obvious? The Vulgate translation,
&ldquo;Give us to-day our super-substantial bread,&rdquo; though it has
the air of providing for the Mass, is presumptively the original sense;
and is virtually supported by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223"

55&ndash;57, 59&ndash;61. Naturally the average theologian
(<i>e.g.</i>, Bishop Lightfoot, cited by McClellan) clings to the
conception of a daily appeal to the God for physical sustenance; but in
so doing he is utterly obscuring the original doctrine.</p>
<p>Properly interpreted, the prayer forms a curious parallel to the
close of the tenth satire of Juvenal, above cited, where all praying
for concrete boons is condemned, on the ground that the Gods know best,
and that man is dearer to them than to himself; but where there is
permitted (of course, illogically) an appeal for soundness of mind and
spiritual serenity. The documents would be nearly contemporary, and,
though independent, would represent kindred processes of ethical and
rational improvement on current religious practice. On the other hand,
the prayer, &ldquo;lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil&rdquo;&mdash;which again rings alien to the context&mdash;would
have been scouted by Juvenal as representing a bad survival of the
religion of fear. Several early citations and early MSS., it should be
noted, give a briefer version of the prayer, beginning, &ldquo;Father,
hallowed be thy name,&rdquo; and dropping the &ldquo;Thy will be
done&rdquo; clause, as well as the &ldquo;deliver us from evil,&rdquo;
though including the &ldquo;lead us not into temptation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may or may not have been that this rationalization of religion
was originally preached by the same sect or school as gave the exalted
counsel to resist not evil and to love enemies&mdash;a line of thought
found alike in India and in China, and, in the moderate form of a veto
on retaliation, in Greece and Rome.<a class="noteref" id=

doctrine that a little faith might suffice to move mountains&mdash;a
development from the mysticisms of the Hebrew prophets&mdash;could
count for nothing save as an incitement to prayer in general. The
freethinking elements in the gospels, in short, were precisely those
which historic Christianity inevitably cast aside.</p>

impulse, comes into prominence; and insofar as they criticized pagan

the primitive rationalism of Ev&ecirc;meros was turned by them to
account; and a series of Fathers, including Clement of Alexandria,
Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine, pressed the case against the pagan
creeds with an unflagging malice which, if exhibited by later
rationalists towards their own creed, Christians would characterize in
strong terms. But the practice of criticism towards other creeds was,
with the religious as with the philosophical sects, no help to
self-criticism. The attitude of the Christian mass towards pagan idols
and the worship of the Emperor was rather one of frenzy<a class=

the unbelieving Lucian brightly banters, they taunt and asperse, in the

to realize the bearing against his own creed of the pagan argument that
to die and to suffer is to give proof of non-deity.<a class="noteref"

the end, the very image-worship which had been the main ground of their
rational attack on paganism became the universal usage of their own

later pagans had been.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13244src" href=

proof <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=

collapse of the ancient civilization, to think with some freedom on
their religious problems.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13361src" href=
"#xd25e13361" name="xd25e13361src">46</a> In the terms of the
case&mdash;apart from the Judaizing of the Elcesaites and Clemens
Romanus&mdash;the thought is an adaptation of pagan speculation,
chiefly oriental and Egyptian; and the commonest characteristics are:
(1) in theology, an explanation of the moral confusion of the world by
assuming two opposed Powers,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13373src" href=
"#xd25e13373" name="xd25e13373src">47</a> or by setting a variety of
good and bad subordinate powers between the world and the Supreme
Being; and (2) in ethics, an insistence either on the inherent
corruptness of matter or on the incompatibility of holiness with
physical pleasure.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13391src" href=
"#xd25e13391" name="xd25e13391src">48</a> The sects influenced chiefly
from Asia teach, as a rule, a doctrine of two great opposing Powers;
those influenced from Egypt seek rather the solution of gradation of
power under one chief God. All alike showed some hostility to the
pretensions of the Jews. Thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">1. Saturninus of Antioch (second century) taught of a
Good and an Evil Power, and that the world and man were made by the
seven planetary spirits, without the knowledge or consent of either
Power; both of whom, however, sought to take control, the Good God
giving men rational souls, and subjecting them to seven Creators, one
of whom was the God of the Jews. Christ was a spirit sent to bring men
back to the Good God; but only their asceticism could avail to
consummate the scheme. (Iren&aelig;us, <i>Against Heresies</i>, i, 24;
Epiphanius, <i lang="la">H&aelig;reses</i>, xxiii.)</p>
<p>2. Similarly, Marcion (son of a bishop of Pontus) placed between the
good and bad Powers the Creator of the lower world, who was the God and
Lawgiver of the Jews, a mixed nature, but just: the other nations being
subjects of the Evil Power. Jesus, a divine spirit sent by the Supreme
God to save men, was opposed by both the God of the Jews and the Evil
Power; and asceticism is the way to carry out his saving purpose. Of
the same cast were the sects of Bardesanes and Tatian. (Iren&aelig;us,
<i>Against Heresies</i>, i, 27, 28; Epiphanius, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span><i lang="la">H&aelig;reses</i>, c. 56; Eusebius,
<i>Eccles. Hist.</i> iv, 30. Mosheim, <i>E. H.</i> 2 Cent. pt. ii, ch.
v, &sect;&sect; 7&ndash;9. As to Marcion, see Harnack, <i>Outlines</i>,
ch. v; Mackay, <i>Rise and Progress of Christianity</i>, pt. iii,
&sect;&sect; 7, 12, 13; Iren&aelig;us, iv, 29, 30; Tertullian,
<i>Against Marcion</i>.)</p>
<p>3. The Manichean creed (attributed to the Persian Mani or
Manich&aelig;us, third century) proceeded on the same dualistic lines.
In this the human race had been created by the Power of Evil or
Darkness, who is the God of the Jews, and hence the body and its
appetites are primordially evil, the good element being the rational
soul, which is part of the Power of Light. By way of combining
Christism and Mithraism, Christ is virtually identified with Mithra,
and Manich&aelig;us claims to be the promised Paraclete. Ultimately the
Evil Power is to be overcome, and kept in eternal darkness, with the
few lost human souls. Here again the ethic is extremely ascetic, and
there is a doctrine of purgatory. (Milman, <i>Hist. of
Christianity</i>, bk. iii, ch. i; Mosheim, <i>E. H.</i> 3 Cent. pt. ii,
ch. v, &sect;&sect; 2&ndash;11; Beausobre, <i lang="fr">Hist. Critique
de Manich&eacute;e et du Manich&eacute;isme</i>, 1734; Lardner,
<i>Cred. of the Gospels</i>, pt. ii, ch. lxiii.)</p>
<p>4. Among the Egyptian Gnostics, again, Basilides taught that the one
Supreme God produced seven perfect secondary Powers, called &AElig;ons
(Ages), two of whom, Dynamis and Sophia (Power and Wisdom), procreated
superior angels, who built a heaven, and in turn produced lower grades
of angels, which produced others, till there were 365 grades, all ruled
by a Prince named Abraxas (whose name yields the number 365). The
lowest grades of angels, being close to eternal matter (which was evil
by nature), made thereof the world and men. The Supreme God then
intervened, like the Good Power in the oriental system, to give men
rational souls, but left them to be ruled by the lower angels, of whom
the Prince became God of the Jews. All deteriorated, the God of the
Jews becoming the worst. Then the Supreme God sent the Prince of the
&AElig;ons, Christ, to save men&rsquo;s souls. Taking the form of the
man Jesus, he was slain by the God of the Jews. Despite charges to the
contrary, this system too was ascetic, though lenient to paganism.
Similar tenets were held by the sects of Carpocrates and Valentinus,
all rising in the second century; Valentinus setting up Thirty
&AElig;ons, male and female, in pairs, with four unmarried males,
guardians of the Pleroma or Heaven&mdash;namely, Horus, Christ, the
Holy Spirit, <i>and</i> Jesus. The youngest &AElig;on, Sophia, brought
forth a daughter, Achamoth (<i>Scientia</i>), who made the world out of
rude matter, and produced Demiourgos, the Artificer, who further
manipulated matter. (Iren&aelig;us, bk. i, chs. 24, 25; bk. ii.)</p>
<p>These sects in turn split into others, with endless
peculiarities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=

<p>Such was the relative freethought of credulous theosophic
fantasy,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13498src" href="#xd25e13498" name=
"xd25e13498src">49</a> turning fictitious data to fresh purpose by way
of solving the riddle of the painful earth. The problem was to account
for evil consistently with a Good God; and the orientals, inheriting a
dualistic religion, adapted that; while the Egyptians, inheriting a
syncretic monotheism, set up grades of Powers between the All-Ruler and
men, on the model of the grades between the Autocrat, ancient or
modern, and his subjects. The Manich&aelig;ans, the most thoroughly
organized of all the outside sects, appear to have absorbed many of the
adherents of the great Mithraic religion, and held together for
centuries, despite fierce persecution and hostile propaganda, their
influence subsisting till the Middle Ages.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">More persistently dangerous to the ancient Church were
the successive efforts of the struggling spirit of reason within to
rectify in some small measure its most arbitrary dogmas. Of these
efforts the most prominent were the quasi-Unitarian doctrine of
<span class="sc">Arius</span> (fourth century), and the opposition by
<span class="sc">Pelagius</span> and his pupil <span class=
"sc">C&aelig;lestius</span> (early in fifth century) to the doctrine of
hereditary sin and predestinate salvation or damnation&mdash;a Judaic
conception dating in the Church from Tertullian, and unknown to the
Greeks.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13551src" href="#xd25e13551" name=
"xd25e13551src">54</a></p>
<p>The former was the central and one of the most intelligible
conflicts in the vast medley of early discussion over the nature of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>the Person of the Founder&mdash;a theme
susceptible of any conceivable formula, when once the principle of
deification was adopted. Between the Gnosticism of Athenagoras, which
made the Logos the direct manifestation of Deity, and the Judaic view
that Jesus was &ldquo;a mere man,&rdquo; for stating which the
Byzantine currier Theodotos was excommunicated at Rome by Bishop
Victor<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13561src" href="#xd25e13561" name=
"xd25e13561src">55</a> in the third century, there were a hundred
possible fantasies of discrimination;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13564src" href="#xd25e13564" name="xd25e13564src">56</a> and the
record of them is a standing revelation of the intellectual delirium in
the ancient Church. Theodotos the currier is said to have made
disciples<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13570src" href="#xd25e13570" name=
"xd25e13570src">57</a> who induced one Natalius to become &ldquo;a
bishop of this heresy&rdquo;; and his doctrine was repeatedly revived,
notably by Artemon. According to a trinitarian opponent, they were much
given to science, in particular to geometry and medicine.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e13573src" href="#xd25e13573" name=
"xd25e13573src">58</a> But such an approach to rationalism could not
prosper in the atmosphere in which Christianity arose. Arianism itself,
when put on its defence, pronounced Jesus to be God, after beginning by
declaring him to be merely the noblest of created beings, and thus
became merely a modified mysticism, fighting for the conception
<i lang="la">homoiousios</i> (of similar nature) as against that of
<i lang="la">homoousios</i> (of the same nature).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13583src" href="#xd25e13583" name="xd25e13583src">59</a> Even at
that, the sect split up, its chief dissenters ranking as semi-Arians,
and many of the latter at length drifting back to Nicene
orthodoxy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13592src" href="#xd25e13592"
name="xd25e13592src">60</a> At first strong in the east, where it
persecuted when it could, it was finally suppressed, after endless
strifes, by Theodosius at the end of the fourth century; only to
reappear in the west as the creed of the invading Goths and Lombards.
In the east it had stood for ancient monotheism; in the west it
prospered by early missionary and military chance till the Papal
organization triumphed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13595src" href=
"#xd25e13595" name="xd25e13595src">61</a> Its suppression meant the
final repudiation of rationalism; though it had for the most part
subsisted as a fanaticism, no less than did the Nicene creed.</p>
<p>More philosophical, and therefore less widespread, was the doctrine
associated in the second century with the name of Praxeas, in the third
with those of Sabellius and Paul of Samosata, and in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>the
fourth with that of Photinus. Of this the essence was the conception of
the triune deity as being not three persons but three modes or aspects
of one person&mdash;a theorem welcomed in the later world by such
different types of believer as Servetus, Hegel, and Coleridge. Far too
reasonable for the average believer, and far too unpropitious to ritual
and sacraments for the average priest, it was always condemned by the
majority, though it had many adherents in the east, until the
establishment of the Church made Christian persecution a far more
effective process than pagan persecution had ever been.</p>
<p>Pelagianism, which unlike Arianism was not an ecclesiastical but a
purely theological division,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13607src" href=
"#xd25e13607" name="xd25e13607src">62</a> fared better, the problem at
issue involving the permanent crux of religious ethics. Augustine,
whose supreme talent was for the getting up of a play of dialectic
against every troublesome movement in turn, without regard to his
previous positions,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13613src" href=
"#xd25e13613" name="xd25e13613src">63</a> undertook to confute Pelagius
and C&aelig;lestius as he did every other innovator; and his influence
was such that, after they had been acquitted of heresy by a church
council in Palestine and by the Roman pontiff, the latter was induced
to change his ground and condemn them, whereupon many councils followed
suit, eighteen Pelagian bishops being deposed in Italy. At that period
Christendom, faced by the portent of the barbarian conquest of the
Empire, was well adjusted to a fatalistic theology, and too uncritical
in its mood to realize the bearing of such doctrine either on conduct
or on sacerdotal pretensions. But though the movement in its first form
was thus crushed, and though in later forms it fell considerably short
of the measure of ethical rationalism seen in the first, it soon took
fresh shape in the form of so-called semi-Pelagianism, and so held its
ground while any culture subsisted;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13622src" href="#xd25e13622" name="xd25e13622src">64</a> while
Pelagianism on the theme of the needlessness of &ldquo;prevenient
grace,&rdquo; and the power of man to secure salvation of his own will,
has been chronic in the Church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">For a concise view of the Pelagian tenets see
Murdock&rsquo;s note on Mosheim, following Walch and Schlegel
(Reid&rsquo;s edition, pp. 208&ndash;209). They included (1) denial
that Adam&rsquo;s sin was inherited; (2) assertion that death is
strictly natural, and not a mere punishment for Adam&rsquo;s sin; (3)
denial that children and virtuous adults dying unbaptized are damned, a
middle <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>state being provided for them; (4) assertion
that good acts come of a good will, and that the will is free; grace
being an enlightenment of the understanding, and not indispensable to
all men. The relative rationalism of these views is presumptively to be
traced to the facts that Pelagius was a Briton and C&aelig;lestius an
Irishman, and that both were Greek scholars. (When tried in Palestine
they spoke Greek, like the council, but the accuser could speak only
Latin.) They were thus bred in an atmosphere not yet laden with Latin
dogma. In &ldquo;confuting&rdquo; them Augustine developed the doctrine
(intelligible as that of an elderly polemist in a decadent society)
that all men are predestined to salvation or damnation by God&rsquo;s
&ldquo;mere good pleasure&rdquo;&mdash;a demoralizing formula which he
at times hedged with illogical qualifications. (Cp. Murdock&rsquo;s
note on Mosheim, as cited, p. 210; Gieseler, &sect; 87.) But an
orthodox champion of Augustine describes him as putting the doctrine
without limitations (Rev. W. R. Clarke, <i>St. Augustine</i>, in
&ldquo;The Fathers for English Readers&rdquo; series, p. 132). It was
never adopted in the east (Gieseler, p. 387), but became part of
Christian theology, especially under Protestantism. On the other hand,
the Council of Trent erected several Pelagian doctrines into articles
of faith; and the Protestant churches have in part since followed. See
Sir W. Hamilton&rsquo;s <i>Discussions on Philosophy and
Literature</i>, 1852, pp. 493&ndash;94, <i>note</i>; and Milman,
<i>Hist. of Latin Christianity</i>, i, 142, 149.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Latin Church thus finally maintained in religion the tradition
of sworn adherence to sectarian formulas which has been already noted
in the Roman philosophic sects, and in so doing reduced to a minimum
the exercise of the reason, alike in ethics and in philosophy. Its
dogmatic code was shaped under the influence of (1) Iren&aelig;us and
Tertullian, who set scripture above reason and, when pressed by
heretics, tradition above even scripture,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13648src" href="#xd25e13648" name="xd25e13648src">65</a> and (2)
Augustine, who had the same tendencies, and whose incessant energy
secured him a large influence. That influence was used not only to
dogmatize every possible item of the faith, but to enforce in religion
another Roman tradition, formerly confined to politics&mdash;that of
systematic coercion of heretics. Before and around Augustine there had
indeed been abundant mutual persecution of the bitterest kind between
the parties of the Church as well as against pagans; the Donatists, in
particular, with their organization of armed fanatics, the
Circumcelliones, had inflicted and suffered at intervals all the worst
horrors of civil war in Africa during a hundred years; Arians and
Athanasians came again and again to mutual bloodshed; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>and
the slaying of the pagan girl-philosopher, Hypatia,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e13656src" href="#xd25e13656" name="xd25e13656src">66</a> by
the Christian monks of Alexandria is one of the vilest episodes in the
whole history of religion. On the whole, it is past question that the
amount of homicide wrought by all the pagan persecution of the earlier
Christians was not a tithe of that wrought by their successors in their
own quarrels. But the spirit which had so operated, and which had been
repudiated even by the bitter Tertullian, was raised by Augustine to
the status of a Christian dogma,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13662src"
href="#xd25e13662" name="xd25e13662src">67</a> which, of course, had
sufficient support in the sacred books, Judaic and Jesuist, and which
henceforth inspired such an amount of murderous persecution in
Christendom as the ancient world had never seen. When, the temple
revenues having been already confiscated, the pagan worships were
finally overthrown and the temples appropriated by the edict of
Honorius in the year 408, Augustine, &ldquo;though not entirely
consistent, disapproved of the forcible demolition of the
temples.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13679src" href="#xd25e13679"
name="xd25e13679src">68</a> But he had nothing to say against the
forcible suppression of their worship, and of the festivals. Ambrose
went as far;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13692src" href="#xd25e13692"
name="xd25e13692src">69</a> and such men as Firmicus Maternus would
have had the emperors go much further.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13698src" href="#xd25e13698" name="xd25e13698src">70</a></p>
<p>Economic interest had now visibly become at least as potent in the
shaping of the Christian course as it had ever been in building up a
pagan cult. For the humble conditions in which the earlier priests and
preachers had gained a livelihood by ministering to scattered groups of
poor proselytes, there had been substituted those of a State Church,
adopted as such because its acquired range of organization had made it
a force fit for the autocrat&rsquo;s purposes when others had failed.
The sequent situation was more and more unfavourable to both sincerity
of thought and freedom of speech. Not only did thousands of
wealth-seekers promptly enter the priesthood to profit by the new
endowments allotted by Constantine to the great metropolitan churches.
Almost as promptly the ideal of toleration was renounced; and the
Christians began against the pagans a species of persecution that
proceeded on no higher motive than greed of gain. Not only were the
revenues of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>the temples confiscated as we have seen, but a
number of Christians took to the business of plundering pagans in the
name of the laws of Constantius forbidding sacrifice, and confiscating
the property of the temples. Libanius, in his <i>Oration for the
Temples</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e13709src" href="#xd25e13709"
name="xd25e13709src">71</a> (390), addressed to Theodosius,
circumstantially avers that the bands of monks and others who went
about demolishing and plundering temples were also wont to rob the
peasants, adding:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">They also seize the lands of some, saying &ldquo;it is
sacred&rdquo;; and many are deprived of their paternal inheritance upon
a false pretence. Thus those men thrive upon other people&rsquo;s ruin
who say &ldquo;they worship God with fasting.&rdquo; And if they who
are wronged come to the pastor in the city &hellip; he commends (the
robbers) and rejects the others&#8202;&hellip;. Moreover, if they hear
of any land which has anything that can be plundered, they cry
presently, &ldquo;Such an one sacrificeth, and does abominable things,
and a troop ought to be sent against him.&rdquo; And presently the
self-styled reformers (<span class="trans" title=

exploits&#8202;&hellip;. But they say, &ldquo;We have only punished
those who sacrifice and thereby <span class="corr" id="xd25e13729"
title="Source: trangress">transgress</span> the law which forbids
sacrifice.&rdquo; O emperor, when they say this, they
lie&#8202;&hellip;. Can it be thought that they who are not able to
bear the sight of a collector&rsquo;s cloak should despise the power of
your government?&hellip; I appeal to the guardians of the law [to
confirm the denial].<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13732src" href=

<p>The whole testimony is explicit and weighty,<a class="noteref" id=

being corroborated by Ammianus Marcellinus, is accepted by clerical

<p>The official creed, with its principle of rigid uniformity and
compulsion, is now recognizable as the only expedient by which the
Church could be held together for its economic ends. Under the Eastern
Empire, accordingly, when once a balance of creed was attained in the
Church, the same coercive ideal was enforced, with whatever differences
in the creed insisted on. Whichever phase of dogma was in power,
persecution of opponents went on as a matter <span class=

no survival of the love of reason that some of the more stubborn
heresies, driven into communion with the new civilization of the Arabs,
were the means of carrying some of the seeds of ancient thought down
the ages, to fructify ultimately in the mental soil of modern
Europe.</p>

Whatever may have been his indirect value of his habit of dialectic, he
again and again declares for prone faith and against the resort to
reason; and to this effect may be cited a long series of Fathers and

<p>Such arguments were doubtless potent to stupefy what remained of
critical faculty in the Roman world. In the same period Salvian makes a
polemic against those who in Christian Gaul denied that God exercised
any government on earth.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13848src" href=

"xd25e13853src">89</a></p>
<p>In general, the orthodox polemic is interesting only insofar as it
preserves that of the opposition. The <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i> by
Justin Martyr (about 150) is a mere documental discussion between a
Christian and a Jew, each founding on the Hebrew Scriptures, and the
Christian doing nearly all of the argument. There is not a scintilla of
independent rationalism in the whole tedious work.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e13883src" href="#xd25e13883" name="xd25e13883src">90</a>
Justin was a type of the would-be &ldquo;philosopher&rdquo; who
confessedly would take no trouble to study science or philosophize, but
who found his sphere in an endless manipulation of the texts of sacred
books. But the work of the learned Origen <i>Against Celsus</i>
preserves for us a large part of the <i>True Discourse</i> of Celsus, a
critical and extremely well-informed argument against Christianity by a
pagan of the Platonic<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13898src" href=
"#xd25e13898" name="xd25e13898src">91</a> school in the time of Marcus
Aurelius,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13902src" href="#xd25e13902" name=

rationalistic.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13905src" href="#xd25e13905"
name="xd25e13905src">93</a> The line of rejoinder followed by Origen,
one of the most cultured of the Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>Fathers, is for the
most part otherwise. When Celsus argues that it makes no difference by
what name the Deity is called, Origen answers<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13913src" href="#xd25e13913" name="xd25e13913src">94</a> that on
the contrary certain God-names have a miraculous or magical virtue for
the casting out of evil spirits; that this mystery is known and
practised by the Egyptians and Persians; and that the mere name of
Jesus has been proved potent to cast out many such demons. When, on the
other hand, Celsus makes a Jew argue against the Christist creed on the
basis of the Jewish story that the founder&rsquo;s birth was
illegitimate,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13916src" href="#xd25e13916"

when he convicts Celsus&rsquo;s Jew of arguing alternately that the

"noteref" id="xd25e13926src" href="#xd25e13926" name=
"xd25e13926src">98</a> This part of the discussion is interesting
chiefly as showing how educated Jews combated the gospels in detail, at
a level of criticism not always above that of the believers. Sometimes
the Jew&rsquo;s case is shrewdly put, as when he asks,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e13929src" href="#xd25e13929" name=
"xd25e13929src">99</a> &ldquo;Did Jesus come into the world for this
purpose, that we should not believe him?&rdquo;&mdash;a challenge not
to be met by Origen&rsquo;s theology. One of the acutest of
Celsus&rsquo;s thrusts is the remark that Jesus himself declared that
miracles would be wrought after him by followers of Satan, and that the
argument from miracles is thus worthless.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13932src" href="#xd25e13932" name="xd25e13932src">100</a> To this
the rejoinder of Origen is suicidal; but at times the assailant,
himself a believer in all manner of miracles, gives away his advantage
completely enough.</p>
<p>Of a deeper interest are the sections in which Celsus (himself a
believer in a Supreme Deity and a future state, and in a multitude of
lower Powers, open to invocation) rests his case on grounds of general
reason, arguing that the true Son of God must needs have brought home
his mission to all mankind;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13937src" href=
"#xd25e13937" name="xd25e13937src">101</a> and sweeps aside as foolish

"xd25e13940src" href="#xd25e13940" name="xd25e13940src">102</a> of
which he had given a sample. Most interesting of all are the
chapters<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13943src" href="#xd25e13943" name=
"xd25e13943src">103</a> in which the Christian cites the pagan&rsquo;s
argument against the homo-centric theory of things. Celsus insists on
the large impartiality of Nature, and repudiates the fantasy that the
whole scheme is adjusted to the well-being and the salvation of man.
Here the Christian, standing for his faith, may be said to carry on,
though in the spirit of a new fanaticism, the anti-scientific humanism
first set up by Sokrates; while the pagan, though touched by religious
apriorism, and prone to lapse from logic to mysticism in his turn,
approaches <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>the scientific standpoint of the elder thinkers
who had set religion aside.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13948src" href=
"#xd25e13948" name="xd25e13948src">104</a> Not for thirteen hundred
years was his standpoint to be regained among men. His protest against
the Christian cultivation of blind faith,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13958src" href="#xd25e13958" name="xd25e13958src">105</a> which
Origen tries to meet on rationalistic lines, would in a later age be
regarded as conveying no imputation. Even the simple defensive
subtleties of Origen are too rationalistic for the succeeding
generations of the orthodox. The least embittered of the Fathers, he is
in his way the most reasonable; and in his unhesitating resort to the
principle of allegory, wherever his documents are too hard for belief,
we see the last traces of the spirit of reason as it had been in Plato,
not yet paralysed by faith. Henceforth, till a new intellectual life is
set up from without, Christian thought is more and more a mere
disputation over the unintelligible, in terms of documents open always
to opposing constructions.</p>
<p>Against such minds the strictest reason would be powerless; and it
was fitting enough that <span class="sc">Lucian</span>, the last of the
great freethinkers of the Hellenistic world, should merely turn on
popular Christianity some of his serene satire<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13966src" href="#xd25e13966" name=
"xd25e13966src">106</a>&mdash;more, perhaps, than has come down to us;
though, on the other hand, his authorship of the <i lang="la">De Morte
Peregrini</i>, which speaks of the &ldquo;crucified sophist,&rdquo; has
been called in question.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13975src" href=
"#xd25e13975" name="xd25e13975src">107</a> The forcible-feeble dialogue
<i lang="la">Philopatris</i>, falsely attributed to Lucian, and clearly
belonging to the reign of Julian, is the last expression of general
skepticism in the ancient literature. The writer, a bad imitator of
Lucian, avows disbelief alike in the old Gods and in the new, and
professes to respect, if any, the &ldquo;Unknown God&rdquo; of the
Athenians; but he makes no great impression of intellectual sincerity.
Apart from this, and the lost anti-Christian work<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13991src" href="#xd25e13991" name="xd25e13991src">108</a> of
Hierocles, Governor of Bithynia under Diocletian, the last direct
literary opponents of ancient Christianity were Porphyry and Julian. As
both were believers in many Gods, and opposed Christianity because it
opposed these, neither can well rank on that score as a freethinker,
even in the sense in which the speculative Gnostics were so. The bias
of both, like that of Plutarch, seems to have been to the utmost
latitude of religious belief; and, apart from personal provocations and
the ordinary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>temper of religious conservatism, it was the
exiguity of the Christian creed that repelled them. Porphyry&rsquo;s
treatise, indeed, was answered by four Fathers,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14001src" href="#xd25e14001" name="xd25e14001src">109</a> all of
whose replies have disappeared, doubtless in fulfilment of the imperial
edict for the destruction of Porphyry&rsquo;s book&mdash;a dramatic
testimony to the state of mental freedom under Theodosius II.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14004src" href="#xd25e14004" name=
"xd25e14004src">110</a> What is known of his argument is preserved in
the incidental replies of Jerome, Augustine, Eusebius, and
others.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14010src" href="#xd25e14010" name=
"xd25e14010src">111</a> The answer of Cyril to Julian has survived,
probably in virtue of Julian&rsquo;s status. His argumentations against
the unworthy elements, the exclusiveness, and the absurdities of the
Jewish and Christian faith are often reasonable enough, as doubtless
were those of Porphyry;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14018src" href=
"#xd25e14018" name="xd25e14018src">112</a> but his own theosophic
positions are hardly less vulnerable; and Porphyry&rsquo;s were
probably no better, to judge from his preserved works. Yet it is to be
said that the habitual tone and temper of the two men compares
favourably with that of the polemists on the other side. They had
inherited something of the elder philosophic spirit, which is so far to
seek in patristic literature, outside of Origen.</p>
<p>The latest expressions of rationalism among churchmen were to the
full as angrily met by the champions of orthodoxy as the attacks of
enemies; and, indeed, there was naturally something of bitterness in
the resistance of the last few critical spirits in the Church to the
fast-multiplying insanities of faith. Thus, at the end of the fourth
century, the Italian monk <span class="sc">Jovinian</span> fought
against the creed of celibacy and asceticism, and was duly denounced,
vituperated, ecclesiastically condemned, and banished, penal laws being
at the same time passed against those who adhered to him.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14032src" href="#xd25e14032" name=
"xd25e14032src">113</a> Contemporary with him was the Eastern
<span class="sc">Aerius</span>, who advocated priestly equality as
against episcopacy, and objected to prayers for the dead, to fasts, and
to the too significant practice of slaying a lamb at the Easter
festival.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14038src" href="#xd25e14038" name=
"xd25e14038src">114</a> In this case matters went the length of schism.
With less of practical effect, in the next century, <span class=
"sc">Vigilantius</span> of Aquitaine made a more general resistance to
a more manifold superstition, condemning and ridiculing the veneration
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>of tombs and bones of martyrs, pilgrimages to
shrines, the miracle stories therewith connected, and the practices of
fasting, celibacy, and the monastic life. He too was promptly put down,
largely by the efforts of his former friend Jerome, the most voluble
and the most scurrilous pietist of his age, who had also denounced the
doctrine of Jovinian.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14047src" href=
"#xd25e14047" name="xd25e14047src">115</a> For centuries no such appeal
was heard in the western Church.</p>
<p>The spirit of reason, however, is well marked at the beginning of
the fifth century in a pagan writer who belongs more truly to the
history of freethought than either Julian or Porphyry. <span class=
"sc">Macrobius</span>, a Roman patrician of the days of Honorius, works
out in his <i>Saturnalia</i>, with an amount of knowledge and
intelligence which for the time is remarkable, the principle that all
the Gods are but personifications of aspects or functions of the Sun.
But such doctrine must have been confined, among pagans, to the
cultured few; and the monotheism of the same writer&rsquo;s treatise
<i>On the Dream of Scipio</i> was probably not general even among the
remaining pagans of the upper class.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14080src" href="#xd25e14080" name="xd25e14080src">116</a></p>
<p>After Julian, open rationalism being already extinct, anti-Christian
thought was simply tabooed; and though the leading historians for
centuries were pagans, they only incidentally venture to betray the
fact. It is told, indeed, that in the days of Valens and Valentinian an
eminent physician named Posidonius, son of a great physician and
brother of another, was wont to say, &ldquo;that men do not grow
fanatic by the agency of evil spirits, but merely by the superfluity of
certain evil humours; and that there is no power in evil spirits to
assail the human race&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14088src"
href="#xd25e14088" name="xd25e14088src">117</a> but though that opinion
may be presumed to have been held by some other physicians, the special
ascription of it to Posidonius is a proof that it was rarely avowed.

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=

boasting<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14125src" href="#xd25e14125" name=
"xd25e14125src">120</a> that the works of the anti-Christian writers
had persuaded nobody, and had almost disappeared. As regarded open
teaching, it was only too true, though the statement clashes with
Chrysostom&rsquo;s own complaint that Porphyry had led many away from
the faith.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14131src" href="#xd25e14131"
name="xd25e14131src">121</a> Proclus was still to come (410&ndash;485),
with his eighteen <i>Arguments against the Christians</i>, proceeding
on the principle, still cherished from the old science, that the world
was eternal. But such teaching could not reach even the majority of the
more educated; and the Jewish dogma of creation <i lang="la">ex
nihilo</i> became sacrosanct truth for the darkening world. In the east
Eusebius,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14143src" href="#xd25e14143" name=

expressed for the whole Church a boundless contempt of everything in
the nature of scientific research or discussion; and it was in fact at
an end for the Christian world for well-nigh a thousand years. For
Lactantius, the doctrine of a round earth and an antipodes was mere
nonsense; he discusses the thesis with the horse-laughter of a
self-satisfied savage.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14153src" href=
"#xd25e14153" name="xd25e14153src">124</a> Under the feet of arrogant
and blatant ignorance we see trampled the first form of the doctrine of
gravitation, not to be recovered for an &aelig;on. Proclus himself
cherished some of the grossest pagan superstitions; and the few
Christians who had in them something of the spirit of reason, as Cosmas
&ldquo;Indicopleustes,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Indian navigator,&rdquo; who
belongs to the sixth century, were turned away from what light they had
by their sacred books. Cosmas was a Nestorian, denying the divinity of
Mary, and a rational critic as regards the orthodox fashion of applying
Old Testament prophecies to Jesus.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14159src"
href="#xd25e14159" name="xd25e14159src">125</a> But whereas pagan
science had inferred that the earth is a sphere, his Bible taught him
that it is an oblong plain; and the great aim of his <i lang=

was to prove this against those who still cultivated science.</p>
<p>Such pleadings were not necessary for the general Christian public,
who knew nothing save what their priests taught them. In
Chrysostom&rsquo;s day this was already the case. There remained but a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=

was that of Theodore of Mopsuestia, the head of the school of Antioch
and the teacher of Nestorius, who taught that many of the Old Testament
prophecies commonly applied to Jesus had reference to pre-Christian
events, and discriminated critically among the sacred books. That of
Job he pronounced to be merely a poem derived from a pagan source, and
the Song of Songs he held to be a mere epithalamium of no religious
significance. In his opinion Solomon had the <span class="trans" title=

"xd25e14197src">127</a> Such thinking must be pronounced the high-water
mark of rational criticism in the ancient Church; and its occurrence in
an age of rapid decay is memorable enough. But in the nature of things
it could meet with only the scantiest support; and the only critical
heresy which bulked at all largely was that of the Unitarian
Anom&oelig;ans or Eunomians,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14201src" href=

criticism had gone from the Christian world, with science, with art,
with philosophy, with culture. But the verdict of time is given in the
persistent recoil of the modern spirit from the literature of the age
of faith to that of the elder age of nascent reason; and the historical
outcome of the state of things in which Chrysostom rejoiced was the
re-establishment of universal idolatry and practical polytheism in the
name of the creed he had preached. Every species of superstition known
to paganism subsisted, slightly transformed. While the emperors
savagely punished the pagan soothsayers, the Christians held by the
same fundamental delusion; and against the devices of pagan magic, in
the reality of which they unquestioningly believed, they professed
triumphantly to practise their own sorceries of holy water, relics,
prayer, and exorcism, no man daring to impugn the insanities of
faith.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14224src" href="#xd25e14224" name=

Jewry, so now in Christendom, the practice of pious fraud became
normal: all early Christian literature, and most of the ecclesiastical
history of many succeeding centuries, is profoundly compromised by the
habitual resort to fiction, forgery, and interpolation. The mystical
poetry of the pagans, the Jewish history of Josephus, the gospels, the
Epistles, all were interpolated in the same spirit as had inspired the
production of new Gospels, new Epistles, new books of Acts, new
Sibylline verses. And even where to this tendency there was opposed the
growing demand of the organized Church for a faithful text, when the
documents had become comparatively ancient, the disposition to invent
and suppress, to reason crookedly, to delude and mislead, was normal
among churchmen. This is the verdict of orthodox ecclesiastical
history, a dozen times repeated.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14258src"

surprise for those who have noted the religious doctrine of Plato, of
Polybius, of Cicero, of Varro, of Strabo, of Dio Cassius.</p>
<p>While intelligence thus retrograded under the reign of faith, it is
impossible to maintain, in the name of historical science, the
conventional claim that the faith wrought a countervailing good. What
moral betterment there was in the decaying Roman world was a matter of
the transformed social conditions, and belongs at least as much to
paganism as to Christianity: even the asceticism of the latter, which
in reality had no reformative virtue for society at large, was a
pre-Christian as well as an anti-Christian phenomenon. It is indeed
probable that in the times of persecution the Christian community would
be limited to the more serious and devoted types<a class="noteref" id=

set up by the legends concerning the martyrs and by the vauntings of
the Fathers, which are demonstrably untrustworthy. The assertion, still
at times made by professed Positivists, that the discredit of the
marriage tie in Roman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href=
"#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>life necessitated a new religion,
and that the new religion was regenerative, is only a quasi-scientific
variation of the legend.</p>

&ldquo;Paul&rdquo; complains bitterly of the sexual licence among his

mystical (<i>id.</i> <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

v. 5</a>), some prescribing ostracism (<i>vv.</i> 9&ndash;13)&mdash;a
plain confession of failure, and a complete reversal of the
prescription in the gospel (<a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2018:22&amp;version=NRSV">Mt.
xviii, 22</a>). If that could be set aside, the command as to divorce
could be likewise. Justin Martyr (<i>Dial. with Trypho</i>, ch. 141)
describes the orthodox Jews of his day as of all men the most given to
polygamy and arbitrary divorce. (Cp. <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2024:1&amp;version=NRSV">
Deut. xxiv, 1</a>; Edersheim, <i>History</i>, p. 294.) Then the
Christian assumption as to Roman degeneration and Eastern virtue cannot
be sustained.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the third century we have the decisive evidence
of Tertullian that many of the charges of immorality made by serious
pagans against Christians were in large part true. First he affirms
(<i lang="la">Ad Nationes</i>, l. i, c. 5) that the pagan charges are
not true of all, &ldquo;<i>not even</i> of the greatest part of
us.&rdquo; In regard to the charge of incest (c. 16), instead of
denying it as the earlier apologist Minucius Felix had done in the age
of persecution, he merely argues that the same offence occurs
<i>through ignorance</i> among the pagans. The chapter concludes by
virtually admitting the charge with regard to misconduct in &ldquo;the
mysteries.&rdquo; Still later, when he has turned Montanist, Tertullian
explicitly charges his former associates with sexual licence (<i lang=
"la">De Jejuniis</i>, cc. 1, 17: <i lang="la">De Virginibus
Velandis</i>, c. 14), pointing now to the heathen as showing more
regard for monogamy than do the Christians (<i lang="la">De Exhort.
Castitatis</i>, c. 13).</p>
<p>From the fourth century onward the history of the Church reveals at
every step a conformity on the part of its members to average pagan
practice. The third canon of the Nicene Council forbids clerics of all
ranks from keeping as companions or housekeepers women who are not
their close blood relations. In the fifth century Salvian denounces the
Christians alike of Gaul and Africa as being boundlessly licentious in
comparison with the Arian barbarians (<i lang="la">De Gubernatione
Dei</i>, lib. 5, 6, 7). They do not even, he declares, deny the charge,
contenting themselves with claiming superior orthodoxy. (Cp. Bury,
<i>Hist. of the Later Roman Empire</i>, i, 198&ndash;99, and Finlay,
ii, 219, for another point of view.) On all hands heresy was reckoned
the one deadly sin (Gieseler, &sect; 74, p. 295, and refs.), and all
real misdeeds came to seem venial by comparison. As to sexual vice and
crime among the Christianized Germans, see Gieseler, &sect; 125, vol.
ii, 158&ndash;60. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245"
name="pb245">245</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the East the conditions were the same. The story of the indecent
performances of Theodora on the stage (Gibbon, ch. xl), probably untrue
of her, implies that such practices openly occurred. Milman (<i>Hist.
of Chr.</i> bk. iv, ch. ii. ed. cited, ii, 327) recognizes general
indecency, and notes that Zosimus charged it on Christian rule. Salvian
speaks of unlimited obscenity in the theatres of Christian Gaul
(<i lang="la">De Gub. Dei</i>, l. 6). Cp. Gibbon as to the character of
the devout Justinian&rsquo;s minister Trebonian; who, however, was
called an atheist. (Suidas, <i>s.v.</i>) On the collapse of the
iconoclastic movement, licence became general (Finlay, <i>Hist. of
Greece</i>, ed. Tozer, ii, 162). But even in the fourth century
Chrysostom&rsquo;s writings testify to the normality of all the vices,
as well as the superstitions, that Christianity is supposed to have
banished; the churches figuring, like the ancient temples, as places of
assignation. (Cp. the extracts of Lavoll&eacute;e, <i lang="fr">Les
M&oelig;urs Byzantines</i>, in <i lang="fr">Essais de
litt&eacute;rature et d&rsquo;histoire</i>, 1891, pp. 48&ndash;62, 89;
the S.P.C.K.&rsquo;s <i>St. Chrysostom&rsquo;s Picture of his Age</i>,
1875, pp. 6, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102&ndash;104, 108, 194;
Chrysostom&rsquo;s <i>Homilies</i>, Eng. tr. 1839, Hom. xii on 1st Cor.
pp. 159&ndash;64; Jerome, <i>Adv. Vigilantium</i>, cited by Gieseler,
ii, 66, note 19, and in Gilly&rsquo;s <i>Vigilantius and his Times</i>,
1844, pp. 406&ndash;407.) The clergy were among the most licentious of
all, and Chrysostom had repeatedly to preach against them
(Lavoll&eacute;e, ch. iv; Mosheim, as last cited; Gibbon, ch. xlvii,
Bohn ed. iv, 232). The position of women was practically what it had
been in post-Alexandrian Greece and Asia-Minor (Lavoll&eacute;e, ch. v;
cp. <i>St. Chrysostom&rsquo;s Picture of his Age</i>, pp.
180&ndash;82); and the practice corresponded. In short, the supposition
that the population of Constantinople as we see it under Justinian, or
that of Alexandria in the same age, could have been morally austere, is
fantastic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would indeed be unintelligible that intellectual decline without
change of social system should put morals on a sound footing. The very
asceticism which seeks to mortify the body is an avowal of the vice
from which it recoils, and insofar as this has prevailed under
Christianity it has specifically hindered general temperance,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14380src" href="#xd25e14380" name=
"xd25e14380src">134</a> inasmuch as the types capable of self-rule thus
leave no offspring.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with the single exception of the case of the
gladiatorial combats (which had been denounced in the first century by
the pagan Seneca,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14385src" href=
"#xd25e14385" name="xd25e14385src">135</a> and in the fourth by the

them),<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14398src" href="#xd25e14398" name=

name="xd25e14427src">139</a> denounces just such atrocities by cruel
mistresses as had been described by Horace and Juvenal. The story of
the slaying of Hypatia, indeed, is decisive as to Christian
ferocity.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14433src" href="#xd25e14433" name=
"xd25e14433src">140</a></p>
<p>In fine, the entire history of Christian Egypt, Asia, and Africa,
progressively decadent till their easy conquest by the Saracens, and
the entire history of the Christian Byzantine empire, at best stagnant
in mental and material life during the thousand years of its existence,
serve conclusively to establish the principle that in the absence of
freethought no civilization can progress. More completely than any of
the ancient civilizations to which they succeeded, they cast out or
were denuded of the spirit of free reason. The result was strictly
congruous. The process, of course, was one of socio-political causation
throughout; and the rule of dogma was a symptom or effect of the
process, not the extraneous cause. But that is only the clinching of
the sociological lesson.</p>
<p>Of a deep significance, in view of the total historical movement, is
the philosophical teaching of the last member of the ancient Roman
world who exhibited philosophical capacity&mdash;the long famous
<span class="sc">Boethius</span>, minister of the conqueror Theodoric,
who put him to death in the year 525. Ostensibly from the same hand we
have the <i lang="la">De Consolatione Philosophiae</i>, which is
substantially non-Christian, and a number of treatises expounding
orthodox Christian dogma. In the former &ldquo;we find him in strenuous
opposition &hellip; to the Christian theory of creation; and his
Dualism is at least as apparent as Plato&rsquo;s. We find him
coquetting with the anti-Christian doctrine of the immortality of the
world, and assuming a position with regard to sin which is
ultra-Pelagian and utterly untenable by a Christian theologian. We find
him, with death before his eyes, deriving consolation not from any
hopes of a resurrection &hellip; but from the present contempt of all
earthly pain and ill which his divine mistress, &lsquo;the perfect
solace of wearied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247"
name="pb247">247</a>]</span>souls,&rsquo; has taught
him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14451src" href="#xd25e14451"
name="xd25e14451src">141</a> Seeing that Theodoric, though a professed
admirer of the ancient life, had absolutely put down, on pain of
death,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14457src" href="#xd25e14457" name=
"xd25e14457src">142</a> every remaining religious practice of paganism,
it is certain that Boethius must have officially professed
Christianity; but his book seems to make it certain that he was not a
believer. The only theory on which the expounder of such an essentially
pagan philosophy can be conceived as really the author of the Christian
tractates ascribed to Boethius is that, under the stroke of undeserved
ruin and unjust doom, the thinker turned away from the creed of his
official life and sought healing in the wisdom of the older
world.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14464src" href="#xd25e14464" name=
"xd25e14464src">143</a> Whether we accept this solution or, in despite
of the specific testimony, reject the theological tractates as falsely
ascribed&mdash;either by their writer or by others&mdash;to
Boethius,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14472src" href="#xd25e14472" name=
"xd25e14472src">144</a> the significant fact remains that it was not
the Christian tracts but the pagan <i>Consolation</i> that passed down
to the western nations of the Middle Ages as the last great
intellectual legacy from the ancient world. It had its virtue for an
age of mental bondage, because it preserved some pulse of the spirit of
free thought. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=

Mackay, <i>Rise and Progress of Christianity</i>, p. 160. Chrysostom
(<i lang="la">De Mundi Creatione</i>, vi, 3) testifies that Porphyry
&ldquo;led many away from the faith.&rdquo; He ably anticipated the
&ldquo;higher criticism&rdquo; of the Book of Daniel. See Baur, as
cited. Porphyry, like Celsus, powerfully retorted on the Old Testament
the attacks made by Christians on the immorality of pagan myths, and
contemned the allegorical explanations of the Christian writers as mere
evasions. The pagan explanations of pagan myths, however, were of the
same order.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Theodosius I, Arcadius, and Theodosius II (379&ndash;450) successively
passed laws forbidding and persecuting paganism (Finlay. i, 286;
Beugnot. <i lang="fr">Hist. de la destr. du paganisme en occident</i>,
i, 350 <i>sq.</i>). Mithraism was suppressed in the same period
(Jerome, <i>Epist.</i> cvii, <i lang="la">ad Laetam</i>, Sokrates,
<i lang="la">Eccles. Hist.</i> bk. v, ch. xvi). It is to be remembered
that Constans and Constantius, the sons of Constantine, had commenced,
at least on paper, to persecute paganism as soon as their
father&rsquo;s new creed was sufficiently established (Cod. Theod. xvi,
10, 2, 4), and this with the entire approval of the whole Church. It
was not their fault that it subsisted till the time of Theodosius II
(cp. Gieseler, &sect; 75, pp. 306&ndash;308; and Beugnot, i,
138&ndash;48). On the edict of Theodosius I see Milman, bk. iii, ch.

by way of explaining that it was a deliberate exercise, not

This is the view of Maurice (<i>Medieval Philosophy</i>, 2nd ed. 1859,
pp. 14&ndash;16), who decides that Boethius was neither a Christian nor
a &ldquo;pagan&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a believer in the pagan Gods.
This is simply to say that he was a rationalist&mdash;a &ldquo;pagan
philosopher,&rdquo; like Aristotle. But, as is noted by Prof. Bury (ed.
of Gibbon, iv. 199), Boethius&rsquo;s authorship of a book, <i lang=
"la">De sancta trinitate, et capita qu&aelig;dam dogmatica, et librum

<p class="first">The freethinking of Mohammed may be justly said to
begin and end with his rejection of popular polytheism and his
acceptance of the idea of a single God. That idea he ostensibly held as
a kind of revelation, not as a result of any traceable process of
reasoning; and he affirmed it from first to last as a fanatic. One of
the noblest of fanatics he may be, but hardly more. Denouncing all
idolatry, he anchored his creed to the Ka&rsquo;aba, the sacred black
stone of the remote past, which is to this day its most revered
object.</p>
<p>That the monotheistic idea, in its most vivid form, reached him in
middle age by way of a vision is part of the creed of his followers;
and that it derived in some way from Jews, or Persians, or Christians,
as the early unbelievers declared,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14507src"
href="#xd25e14507" name="xd25e14507src">2</a> is probable enough. But
there is evidence that among his fellow-Arabs the idea had taken some
slight root before his time, even in a rationalistic form, and it is
clear that there were before his day many believers, though also many
unbelievers, in a future state.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14510src"
href="#xd25e14510" name="xd25e14510src">3</a> There is no good ground
for the oft-repeated formula about the special monotheistic and other
religious proclivities of &ldquo;the Semite&rdquo;;<a class="noteref"

Semites being subject to religious influences like other peoples, in
terms of culture and environment. The Moslems themselves preserved a
tradition that one Zaid, who died five years before the Prophet
received his first inspiration, had of his own accord renounced
idolatry without becoming either Jew or Christian; but on being told by
a Jew to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>become a <i>Hanyf</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14537src" href="#xd25e14537" name="xd25e14537src">5</a> that is
to say, of the religion of Abraham, who worshipped nothing but God, he
at once agreed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14543src" href="#xd25e14543"
name="xd25e14543src">6</a> In the oldest extant biography of Mohammed
an address of Zaid&rsquo;s has been preserved, of which six passages
are reproduced in the Koran;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14552src" href=
"#xd25e14552" name="xd25e14552src">7</a> and there are other
proofs<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14563src" href="#xd25e14563" name=
"xd25e14563src">8</a> that the way had been partly made for
Mohammedanism before Mohammed, especially at Medina, to which he
withdrew (the Hej&rsquo;ra) with his early followers when his
fellow-tribesmen would not accept his message. He uses the term
<i>Hanyf</i> repeatedly as standing for his own doctrine.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14575src" href="#xd25e14575" name=
"xd25e14575src">9</a> In some of the Arab poetry of the generation
before Mohammed, again, there is &ldquo;a deep conviction of the unity
of God, and of his elevation over all other beings,&rdquo; as well as a
clearly developed sense of moral responsibility.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14606src" href="#xd25e14606" name="xd25e14606src">10</a> The
doctrine of a Supreme God was indeed general;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14609src" href="#xd25e14609" name="xd25e14609src">11</a> and
Mohammed&rsquo;s insistence on the rejection of the lesser deities or
&ldquo;companions of God&rdquo; was but a preaching of unitarianism to
half-professed monotheists who yet practised polytheism and idolatry.
The Arabs at his time, in short, were on the same religious plane as
the Christians, but with a good deal of unbelief;
&ldquo;Zend&#275;kism&rdquo; or rationalistic deism (or atheism) being
charged in particular on Mohammed&rsquo;s tribe, the Koreish;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14615src" href="#xd25e14615" name=
"xd25e14615src">12</a> and the Prophet used traditional ideas to bring
them to his unitary creed. In one case he even temporarily accepted
their polytheism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14624src" href=
"#xd25e14624" name="xd25e14624src">13</a> The several tribes were
further to some extent monolatrous,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14627src" href="#xd25e14627" name="xd25e14627src">14</a> somewhat
as were the Semitic tribes of Palestine; and before Mohammed&rsquo;s
time a special worshipper of the star Sirius sought to persuade the
Koreish to give up their idols and adore that star alone. Thus between
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>partially developed monotheism, their partial
familiarity with <i>Hanyf</i> monotheism, and their common intercourse
with the nominally monotheistic Jews and Christians, many Arabs were in
a measure prepared for the Prophet&rsquo;s doctrine; which, for the
rest, embodied many of their own traditions and superstitions as well
as many orally received from Christians and Jews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Koran itself,&rdquo; says Palmer,
&ldquo;is, indeed, less the invention or conception of Mohammed than a
collection of legends and moral axioms borrowed from desert lore and
couched in the language and rhythm of desert eloquence, but adorned
with the additional charm of enthusiasm. Had it been merely
Mohammed&rsquo;s own invented discourses, bearing only the impress of
his personal style, the Koran could never have appealed with so much
success to every Arab-speaking race as a miracle of
eloquence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14639src" href=
"#xd25e14639" name="xd25e14639src">15</a></p>
<p>Kuenen challenges Sprenger&rsquo;s conclusions and sums up:
&ldquo;We need not deny that Mohammed had predecessors; but we must
deny that tradition gives us a faithful representation of them, or is
correct in calling them <i>hanyfs</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14653src" href="#xd25e14653" name="xd25e14653src">16</a> On the
other hand, he concedes that &ldquo;Mohammed <i>made</i> Islam out of
elements which were supplied to him very largely from outside, and
which had a whole history behind them already, so that he could take
them up as they were without further elaboration.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14662src" href="#xd25e14662" name=
"xd25e14662src">17</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;During the first century of Islam the forging of Traditions
became a recognized political and religious weapon, of which all
parties availed themselves. Even men of the strictest piety practised
this species of fraud, and maintained that the end justified the
means.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14669src" href="#xd25e14669"
name="xd25e14669src">18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final triumph of the religion, however, was due neither to the
elements of its Sacred Book nor to the moral or magnetic power of the
Prophet. This power it was that won his first adherents, who were
mostly his friends and relatives, or slaves to whom his religion was a
species of enfranchisement.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14677src" href=
"#xd25e14677" name="xd25e14677src">19</a> From that point forward his
success was military&mdash;thanks, that is, to the valour of his
followers&mdash;his fellow citizens never having been won in mass to
his teaching.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14680src" href="#xd25e14680"
name="xd25e14680src">20</a> Such success as his might conceivably be
gained by a mere military chief. Nor could the spread of Islam after
his death have taken place save in virtue of the special opportunities
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>for conquest lying before its
adherents&mdash;opportunities already seen by Mohammed, either with the
eye of statesmanship or with that of his great general, Omar.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14685src" href="#xd25e14685" name=
"xd25e14685src">21</a> It is an error to assume, as is still commonly
done, that it was the unifying and inspiring power of the religion that
wrought the Saracen conquests. Warlike northern barbarians had overrun
the Western Empire without any such stimulus; the prospect of booty and
racial kinship sufficed them for the conquest of a decadent community;
and the same conditions existed for the equally warlike
Saracens,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14703src" href="#xd25e14703" name=
"xd25e14703src">22</a> who also, before Mohammed, had learned something
of the military art from the Gr&aelig;co-Romans.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14710src" href="#xd25e14710" name="xd25e14710src">23</a> Their
religious ardour would have availed them little against the pagan
legions of the unbelieving C&aelig;sar; and as a matter of fact they
could never conquer, though they curtailed, the comparatively weak
Byzantine Empire; its moderate economic resources and traditional
organization sufficing to sustain it, despite intellectual decadence,
till the age of Saracen greatness was over. Nor did their faith ever
unify them save ostensibly for purposes of common warfare against the
racial foe&mdash;a kind of union attained in all ages and with all
varieties of religion. Fierce domestic strifes broke out as soon as the
Prophet was dead. It would be as true to say that the common racial and
military interest against the Gr&aelig;co-Roman and Persian States
unified the Moslem parties, as that Islam unified the Arab tribes and
factions. Apart from the inner circle of converts, indeed, the first
conquerors were in mass not at all deeply devout, and many of them
maintained to the end of their generation, and after his death, the
unbelief which from the first met the Prophet at Mecca.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14716src" href="#xd25e14716" name=
"xd25e14716src">24</a> Against the creed of Mohammed &ldquo;the
conservative and material instincts of the people of the desert rose in
revolt; and although they became Moslems <i lang="la">en masse</i>, the
majority of them neither believed in Islam nor knew what it meant.
Often their motives were frankly utilitarian: they expected that Islam
would bring them luck&#8202;&hellip;. If things went ill, they blamed
Islam and turned their backs on it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14728src" href="#xd25e14728" name="xd25e14728src">25</a> It is
told of a Moslem chief of the early days that he said: &ldquo;If there
were a God, I would swear by his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252"

in him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14733src" href="#xd25e14733"
name="xd25e14733src">26</a> A general fanaticism grew up later. But had
there been no Islam, enterprising Arabs would probably have overrun
Syria and Persia and Africa and Spain all the same.<a class="noteref"

Attila went further, and he is not known to have been a monotheist or a
believer in Paradise. Nor were Jenghiz Khan and Tamerlane indebted to
religious faith for their conquests.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a Khalifate was anywhere established by
military force, the faith would indeed serve as a nucleus of
administration, and further as a means of resisting the insidious
propaganda of the rival faith, which might have been a source of
political danger. It was their Sacred Book and Prophet that saved the
Arabs from accepting the religion of the states they conquered as did
the Goths and Franks. The faith thus so far preserved their military
polity when that was once set up; but it was not the faith that made
the polity possible, or gave the power of conquest, as is
conventionally held. At most, it partly facilitated their conquests by
detaching a certain amount of purely superstitious support from the
other side. And it never availed to unify the race, or the Islamic
peoples. On the fall of Othman &ldquo;the ensuing civil wars rent the
unity of Islam from top to bottom, and the wound has never
healed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14748src" href="#xd25e14748"

totally failed to unify Semite and Aryan in Persia, the task was
partially accomplished by the Abassides, it was not through any greater
stress of piety, but by way of accepting the inevitable, after

case, on the basis of the abundant pre-Islamic poetry, given but the
material conquests. The first conquerors were illiterate, and had to
resort to the services and the organization of the conquered<a class=

There was nothing in the Koran itself to encourage literature; and the
first conquerors either despised or feared that of the
conquered.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14781src" href="#xd25e14781"
name="xd25e14781src">33</a></p>
<p>When the facts are inductively considered, it appears that the Koran
was from the first rather a force of intellectual fixation than one of
stimulus. As we have seen, there was a measure of rationalism as well
as of monotheism among the Arabs before Mohammed; and the Prophet set
his face violently against all unbelief. The word
&ldquo;unbeliever&rdquo; or &ldquo;infidel&rdquo; in the Koran normally
signifies merely &ldquo;rejector of Mohammed&rdquo;; but a number of
passages<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14786src" href="#xd25e14786" name=
"xd25e14786src">34</a> show that there were specific unbelievers in the
doctrine of a future state as well as in miracles; and his opponents
put to him challenges which showed that they rationally disbelieved his
claim to inspiration.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14789src" href=
"#xd25e14789" name="xd25e14789src">35</a> Hence, clearly, the scarcity
of miracles in his early legend, on the Arab side. On a people thus
partly &ldquo;refined, skeptical, incredulous,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

"xd25e14798src" href="#xd25e14798" name="xd25e14798src">37</a> the
triumph of Islam gradually imposed a tyrannous dogma, entailing
abundance of primitive superstition under the &aelig;gis of
monotheistic doctrine. Some moral service it did compass, and for this
the credit seems to be substantially due to Mohammed; though here again
he was not an innovator. Like previous reformers,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14803src" href="#xd25e14803" name="xd25e14803src">38</a> he
vehemently denounced the horrible practice of burying alive girl
children; and when the Koran became law his command took effect. His
limitation of polygamy too may have counted for something, despite the
unlimited practice of his latter years. For the rest, he prescribes, in
the traditional eastern fashion, liberal almsgiving; this, with normal
integrity and patience, and belief in &ldquo;God and the Last Day, and
the Angels, and the Scriptures, and the Prophets,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14807src" href="#xd25e14807" name=

with much stress on hell-fire and the joys of Paradise, and at the same
time on predestination, and with no reasoning on any issue.</p>

Within a century of the Hej&rsquo;ra<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14820src" href="#xd25e14820" name="xd25e14820src">40</a> there
had arisen some rational skepticism in the Moslem schools, as apart
from the chronic schisms and strifes of the faithful. A school of
theology had been founded by Hasan-al-Basri at Bassorah; and one of his
disciples, Wasil ibn Att&acirc;, following some previous
heretics&mdash;Mabad al Jhoni, Ghailan of Damascus, and Jonas al
Aswari<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14823src" href="#xd25e14823" name=
"xd25e14823src">41</a>&mdash;rejected the predestination doctrine of
the Koran as inconsistent with the future judgment; arguing for
freewill and at the same time for the humane provision of a purgatory.
From this beginning dates the Motazileh or class of Motazilites (or
Mu`tazilites),<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14826src" href="#xd25e14826"
name="xd25e14826src">42</a> the philosophic reformers and moderate
freethinkers of Islam. Other sects of a semi-political character had
arisen even during the last illness of the Prophet, and others soon
after his death.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14841src" href=
"#xd25e14841" name="xd25e14841src">43</a> One party sought to impose on
the faithful the &ldquo;Sunna&rdquo; or &ldquo;traditions,&rdquo; which
really represented the old Arabian ideas of law, but were pretended to
be unwritten sayings of Mohammed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14845src"
href="#xd25e14845" name="xd25e14845src">44</a> To this the party of Ali
(the Prophet&rsquo;s cousin) objected; whence began the long dispute
between the Shiah or Sh&icirc;ites (the anti-traditionists), and the
Sunnites; the conquered and oppressed Persians tending to stand with
the former, and generally, in virtue of their own thought, to supply
the heterodox element under the later Khalifates.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14851src" href="#xd25e14851" name="xd25e14851src">45</a> Thus
Sh&icirc;ites were apt to be Motazilites.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14866src" href="#xd25e14866" name="xd25e14866src">46</a> On
Ali&rsquo;s side, again, there broke away a great body of Kharejites or
Separatists, who claimed that the Imaum or head of the Faith should be
chosen by election, while the Sh&icirc;ites stood for succession by
divine right.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14869src" href="#xd25e14869"
name="xd25e14869src">47</a> All this had occurred before any schools of
theology existed.</p>
<p>The Motazilites, once started, divided gradually into a score of
sects,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14877src" href="#xd25e14877" name=
"xd25e14877src">48</a> all more or less given to rationalizing within
the limits of monotheism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14880src" href=

"pb255">255</a>]</span>promptly ranged the <i>Jabarites</i>, who
affirmed that man&rsquo;s will was wholly under divine constraint
(<i>jabar</i>).<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14914src" href="#xd25e14914"
name="xd25e14914src">51</a> Yet another sect, the <i>Sifatites</i>,
opposed both of the others, some of them<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14920src" href="#xd25e14920" name="xd25e14920src">52</a> standing
for a literal interpretation of the Koran, which is in part
predestinationist, and in parts assumes freewill; while the main body
of orthodox, following the text, professed to respect as insoluble
mystery the contradictions they found in it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14924src" href="#xd25e14924" name="xd25e14924src">53</a> The
history of Islam in this matter is strikingly analogous to that of
Christianity from the rise of the Pelagian heresy.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that, while the heretics in time came under Greek
and other foreign influences, their criticism of the Koran was at the
outset their own.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14932src" href=
"#xd25e14932" name="xd25e14932src">54</a> The Sh&icirc;ites, becoming
broadly the party of the Persians, admitted in time Persian, Jewish,
Gnostic, Manich&aelig;an, and other dualistic doctrines, and generally
tended to interpret the Koran allegorically.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14935src" href="#xd25e14935" name="xd25e14935src">55</a> A
particular school of allegorists, the Bathenians, even tended to purify
the idea of deity in an agnostic direction.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14938src" href="#xd25e14938" name="xd25e14938src">56</a> All of
these would appear to have ranked genetically as Motazilites; and the
manifold play of heretical thought gradually forced a certain habit of
reasoning on the orthodox,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14941src" href=
"#xd25e14941" name="xd25e14941src">57</a> who as usual found their
advantage in the dissidences of the dissenters. On the other hand, the
Motazilites found new resources in the study and translation of Greek
works, scientific and philosophical.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14944src" href="#xd25e14944" name="xd25e14944src">58</a> They
were thus the prime factors, on the Arab side, in the culture-evolution
which went on under the earlier of the Abasside Khalifs
(750&ndash;1258). Greek literature reached them mainly through the
Syrian Christians, in whose hands it had been put by the Nestorians,
driven out of their scientific school at Edessa and exiled by Leo the
Isaurian (716&ndash;741);<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14948src" href=
"#xd25e14948" name="xd25e14948src">59</a> possibly also in part through
the philosophers who, on being exiled from Athens by Justinian, settled
for a time in Persia.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14957src" href=
"#xd25e14957" name="xd25e14957src">60</a> The total result was that
already in the ninth century, within two hundred years of the beginning
of Mohammed&rsquo;s preaching, the Saracens in Persia had reached not
only a remarkable height of material civilization, their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=

considerable though quasi-secret measure of scientific knowledge and
rational thought,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14965src" href=
"#xd25e14965" name="xd25e14965src">61</a> including even some measure
of pure atheism. All forms of rationalism alike were called
<i>zend&#275;kism</i> by the orthodox, the name having the epithetic
force of the Christian terms &ldquo;infidelity&rdquo; and
&ldquo;atheism&rdquo;.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14980src" href=
"#xd25e14980" name="xd25e14980src">62</a></p>
<p>Secrecy was long imposed on the Motazilites by the orthodoxy of the
Khalifs,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14994src" href="#xd25e14994" name=
"xd25e14994src">63</a> who as a rule atoned for many crimes and
abundant breaches of the law of the Koran by a devout profession of
faith. Freethinking, however, had its periods of political prosperity.
Even under the Ommayade dynasty, the Khalif Al Walid Ibn Yazid (the
eleventh of the race) was reputed to be of no religion, but seems to
have been rather a ruffian than a rationalist.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15009src" href="#xd25e15009" name="xd25e15009src">64</a> Under
the Abassides culture made much more progress. The Khalif Al Mansour,
though he played a very orthodox part,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15015src" href="#xd25e15015" name="xd25e15015src">65</a> favoured
the Motazilites (754&ndash;775), being generally a patron of the
sciences; and under him were made the first translations from the
Greek.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15018src" href="#xd25e15018" name=
"xd25e15018src">66</a> Despite his orthodoxy he encouraged science; and
it was as insurgents and not as unbelievers that he destroyed the sect
of Rewandites (a branch of the anti-Moslem Ismailites), who are said to
have believed in metempsychosis.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15027src"
href="#xd25e15027" name="xd25e15027src">67</a> Partly on political but
partly also on religious grounds his successor Al Mahdi made war on the
Ismailites, whom he regarded as atheists, and who appear to have been
connected with the Motazilite &ldquo;Brethren of
Purity,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15031src" href="#xd25e15031"
name="xd25e15031src">68</a> destroying their books and causing others
to be written against them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15034src" href=
"#xd25e15034" name="xd25e15034src">69</a> They were anti-Koranites;
hardly atheists; but a kind of informal rationalism approaching to
atheism, and involving unbelief in the Koran and the Prophet, seems to
have spread considerably, despite the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb257" href="#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>slaughter of many
unbelievers by Al Mahdi. Its source seems to have been Persian aversion
to the alien creed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15042src" href=
"#xd25e15042" name="xd25e15042src">70</a> The great philosophic
influence, again, was that of Aristotle; and though his abstract
God-idea was nominally adhered to, the scientific movement promoted
above all things the conception of a reign of law.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e15053src" href="#xd25e15053" name="xd25e15053src">71</a> Al
Hadi, the successor of Al Mahdi, persecuted much and killed many
heretics; and Haroun Al Raschid (Aaron the Orthodox) menaced with death
those who held the moderately rational tenet that &ldquo;the Koran was
created,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15067src" href="#xd25e15067"
name="xd25e15067src">72</a> as against the orthodox dogma (on all fours
with the Brahmanic doctrine concerning the Veda) that it was eternal in
the heavens and uncreated. One of the rationalists, Al Mozdar, accused
the orthodox party of infidelity, as asserting two eternal things; and
there was current among the Motazilites of his day the saying that,
&ldquo;had God left men to their natural liberty, the Arabians could
have composed something not only equal but superior to the Koran in
eloquence, method, and purity of language.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15071src" href="#xd25e15071" name="xd25e15071src">73</a></p>
<p>Haroun&rsquo;s crimes, however, consisted little in acts of
persecution. The Persian Barmekides (the family of his first Vizier,
surnamed Barmek) were regarded as protectors of Motazilites;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15076src" href="#xd25e15076" name=
"xd25e15076src">74</a> and one of the sons, Jaafer, was even suspected
of atheism, all three indeed being charged with it.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e15082src" href="#xd25e15082" name="xd25e15082src">75</a> Their
destruction, on other grounds, does not seem to have altered the
conditions for the thinkers; but Haroun&rsquo;s incompetent son Emin
was a devotee and persecutor. His abler brother and conqueror Al Mamoun
(813&ndash;833), on the other hand, directly favoured the Motazilites,
partly on political grounds, to strengthen himself with the Persian
party, but also on the ground of conviction.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15088src" href="#xd25e15088" name="xd25e15088src">76</a> He even
imprisoned some of the orthodox theologians who maintained that the
Koran was not a created thing, though, like certain persecutors of
other faiths, he had expressly declared himself in favour of persuasion
as against coercion.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15100src" href=
"#xd25e15100" name="xd25e15100src">77</a> In one case, following usage,
he inflicted a cruel torture. &ldquo;His fatal error,&rdquo; says a
recent scholar, &ldquo;was that he invoked the authority of the State
in matters of the intellectual and religious life.&rdquo;<a class=

"xd25e15103src">78</a> Compared with others, certainly, he did not
carry his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>coercion far, though, on being once publicly
addressed as &ldquo;Ameer of the Unbelievers,&rdquo; he caused the
fanatic who said it to be put to death.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15109src" href="#xd25e15109" name="xd25e15109src">79</a> In
private he was wont to conduct meetings for discussion, attended by
believers and unbelievers of every shade, at which the only restriction
was that the appeal must be to reason, and never to the Koran.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15112src" href="#xd25e15112" name=
"xd25e15112src">80</a> Concerning his personal bias, it is related that
he had received from Kabul a book in old Persian, <i>The Eternal
Reason</i>, which taught that reason is the only basis for religion,
and that revelation cannot serve as a standing ground.<a class=

"xd25e15121src">81</a> The story is interesting, but enigmatic, the
origin of the book being untraceable. Whatever were his views, his
coercive policy against the orthodox extremists had the usual effect of
stimulating reaction on that side, and preparing the ultimate triumph
of orthodoxy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15127src" href="#xd25e15127"
name="xd25e15127src">82</a> The fact remains, however, that Mamoun was
of all the Khalifs the greatest promoter of science<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e15131src" href="#xd25e15131" name="xd25e15131src">83</a> and
culture; the chief encourager of the study and translation of Greek
literature;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15143src" href="#xd25e15143"
name="xd25e15143src">84</a> and, despite his coercion of the
theologians on the dogma of the eternity of the Koran, tolerant enough
to put a Christian at the head of a college at Damascus, declaring that
he chose him not for his religion but for his science. In the same
spirit he permitted the free circulation of the apologetic treatise of
the Armenian Christian Al Kindy, in which Islam and the Koran are
freely criticized. As a ruler, too, he ranks among the best of his race
for clemency, justice, and decency of life, although orthodox
imputations were cast on his subordinates. His successors Motasim and
Wathek were of the same cast of opinion, the latter being, however,
fanatical on behalf of his rationalistic view of the Koran as a created
thing.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15160src" href="#xd25e15160" name=

<p>A violent orthodox reaction set in under the worthless and
Turk-ruled Khalif Motawakkel<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15168src" href=
"#xd25e15168" name="xd25e15168src">86</a> (847&ndash;861), by whose
time the Khalifate was in a state of political decadence, partly from
the economic exhaustion following on its tyrannous and extortionate
rule; partly from the divisive tendencies of its heterogeneous
sections; partly from the corrupting tendency of all despotic
power.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15171src" href="#xd25e15171" name=
"xd25e15171src">87</a> Despite the official restoration of orthodoxy,
the private cultivation of science <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259"
href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>and philosophy proceeded for
a time; the study and translation of Greek books continued;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15176src" href="#xd25e15176" name=
"xd25e15176src">88</a> and rationalism of a kind seems to have
subsisted more or less secretly to the end. In the tenth century it is
said to have reached even the unlearned; and though the Motazilites
gradually drifted into a scholastic orthodoxy, downright unbelief came
up alongside,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15182src" href="#xd25e15182"
name="xd25e15182src">89</a> albeit secretly. Faith in Mohammed&rsquo;s
mission and law began again to shake; and the learned disregarded its
prescriptions. Mystics professed to find the way to God without the
Koran. Many decided that religion was useful for regulating the people,
but was not for the wise. On the other side, however, the orthodox
condemned all science as leading to unbelief,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15186src" href="#xd25e15186" name="xd25e15186src">90</a> and
developed an elaborate and quasi-systematic theology. It was while the
scientific encyclopedists of Bassorah were amassing the knowledge
which, through the Moors, renewed thought in the West, that Al Ashari
built up the <i>Kal&acirc;m</i> or scholastic theology which
thenceforth reigned in the Mohammedan East;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15198src" href="#xd25e15198" name="xd25e15198src">91</a> and the
philosopher Al Gazzali (or Gazel), on his part, employed the ancient
and modern device of turning a profession of philosophical scepticism
to the account of orthodoxy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15210src" href=
"#xd25e15210" name="xd25e15210src">92</a></p>
<p>In the struggle between science and religion, in a politically
decadent State, the latter inevitably secured the administrative
power.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15218src" href="#xd25e15218" name=
"xd25e15218src">93</a> Under the Khalifs Motamid (d. 892) and Motadhed
(d. 902) all science and philosophy were proscribed, and booksellers
were put upon their oath not to sell any but orthodox books.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15221src" href="#xd25e15221" name=
"xd25e15221src">94</a> Thus, though philosophy and science had secretly
survived, when the political end came the popular faith was in much the
same state as it had been under Haroun Al Raschid. Under Islam as under
all the faiths of the world, in the east as in the west, the mass of
the people remained ignorant as well as poor; and the learning and
skill of the scholars served only to pass on the saved treasure of
Greek thought and science to the new civilization of Europe. The fact
that the age of military and political decadence was that of the widest
diffusion of rationalism is naturally fastened on as giving the
explanation of the decline; but the inference is pure fallacy. The
Bagdad Khalifate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260"
name="pb260">260</a>]</span>declined as the Christianized Roman Empire
declined, from political and external causes; and the Turks who
overthrew it proceeded to overthrow Christian Byzantium, where
rationalism never reared its head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The conventional view is thus set forth in a popular
work (<i>The Saracens</i>, by Arthur Gilman, 1887, p. 385):
&ldquo;Unconsciously Mamun began a process by which that implicit faith
which had been at once the foundation and the inspiration of Islam,
which had nerved its warriors in their terrible warfare, and had
brought the nation out of its former obscurity to the foremost position
among the peoples of the world, was to be taken from them.&rdquo; We
have seen that this view is entirely erroneous as regards the rise of
the Saracen power; and it is no less so as regards the decline. At the
outset there had been no &ldquo;implicit faith&rdquo; among the
conquerors. The Eastern Saracens, further, had been decisively defeated
by the Byzantines in the very first flush of their fanaticism and
success; and the Western had been routed by Charles Martel long before
they had any philosophy. There was no overthrow of faith among the
warriors of the Khalifate. The enlistment of Turkish mercenaries by
Mamoun and Motasim, by way of being independent of the Persian and Arab
factions in the army and the State, introduced an element which, at
first purely barbaric, became as orthodox as the men of Haroun&rsquo;s
day had been. Yet the decadence, instead of being checked, was
furthered.</p>
<p>Nor were the strifes set up by the rationalistic view of the Koran
nearly so destructive as the mere faction-fights and sectarian
insurrections which began with Motawakkel. The falling-away of cities
and provinces under the feeble Moktader (908&ndash;932) had nothing
whatever to do with opinions, but was strictly analogous to the
dissolution of the kingdom of Charlemagne under his successors, through
the rise of new provincial energies; and the tyranny of the Turkish
mercenaries was on all fours with that of the Pretorians of the Roman
Empire, and with that of the Janissaries in later Turkey. The writer
under notice has actually recorded (p. 408) that the warlike sect of
Ismailitic Karmathians, who did more than any other enemy to dismember
the Khalifate, were unbelievers in the Koran, deniers of revelation,
and disregarders of prayer. The later Khalifs, puppets in the hands of
the Turks, were one and all devout believers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, fresh Moslem and non-Moslem dynasties arose
alternately as the conditions and opportunities determined. Jenghiz
Khan, who overran Asia, was no Moslem; neither was Tamerlane; but new
Moslem conquerors did overrun India, as pagan Alexander had done in his
day. Theological ideas <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href=
"#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>counted for as little in one case
as in the other. Sultan Mahmoud of Ghazni (997&ndash;1030), who reared
a new empire on the basis of the province of Khorassan and the kingdom
of Bokhara, and who twelve times successfully invaded India, happened
to be of Turkish stock; but he is also recorded to have been in his
youth a doubter of a future state, as well as of his personal
legitimacy. His later parade of piety (as to which see Baron De
Slane&rsquo;s tr. of Ibn Khallikan&rsquo;s <i>Biog. Dict.</i> iii, 334)
is thus a trifle suspect (<i>British India</i>, in Edin. Cab. Lib. 3rd
ed. i, 189, following Ferishta); and his avarice seems to have animated
him to the full as much as his faith, which was certainly not more
devout than that of the Brahmans of Somnauth, whose hold he captured.
(Cp. Prof. E. G. Browne, <i>A Literary History of Persia</i>, ii
(1906), 119.) During his reign, besides, unbelief was rife in his
despite (Weil, <i lang="de">Geschichte der Chalifen</i>, iii, 72),
though he burned the books of the Motazilites, besides crucifying many
Isma&iuml;lian heretics (Browne, p. 160). The conventional theorem as
to the political importance of faith, in short, will not bear
investigation. Even Freeman here sets it aside (<i>Hist. and Conq. of
the Saracens</i>, p. 124).</p>

<p class="first">It is in the later and nominally decadent ages of the
Bagdad Khalifate, when science and culture and even industry relatively
prospered by reason of the personal impotence of the Khalifs, that we
meet with the most pronounced and the most perspicacious of the
Freethinkers of Islam. In the years 973&ndash;1057 there dwelt in the
little Syrian town of Marratun-Numan the blind poet <span class=
"sc">Abu&rsquo;l-ala-al-Ma&rsquo;arri</span>, who wrote a parody of the
Koran,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15263src" href="#xd25e15263" name=

pronounced &ldquo;incomparably greater&rdquo; than Omar Khayy&aacute;m
&ldquo;both as a poet and as an agnostic.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15272src" href="#xd25e15272" name="xd25e15272src">96</a> One of

"#xd25e15278" name="xd25e15278src">97</a> He may have escaped on the

frankness of his heterodoxy is memorable. Nourished perhaps by a temper
of protest set up in him by the blindness which fell upon him in
childhood after smallpox, the spirit of reason seems to have been
effectually developed in him by a stay of a year and a-half at Bagdad,
where, in the days of Al Mansour, &ldquo;Christians and Jews, Buddhists
and Zoroastrians, Sabians and Sufis, materialists and
rationalists,&rdquo; met and communed.<a class="noteref" id=

his visit, his poems are substantially orthodox; later, their burden
changes. He denies a resurrection, and is &ldquo;wholly incredulous of
any divine revelation. Religion, as he conceives it, is a product of
the human mind, in which men believe through force of habit and
education, never stopping to consider whether it is true.&rdquo;

<p class="first">a summing-up not to be improved upon here.</p>
<p>A century later still, and in another region, we come upon the (now)
most famous of all Eastern freethinkers, <span class="sc">Omar
Khayy&aacute;m</span>. He belonged to Naish&aacute;p&uacute;r in
Khorassan, a province which had long been known for its
rationalism,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15311src" href="#xd25e15311"
name="xd25e15311src">101</a> and which had been part of the nucleus of
the great Asiatic kingdom created by Sultan Mahmoud of Ghazni at the
beginning of the eleventh century, soon after the rise of the Fatimite
dynasty in Egypt. Under that Sultan flourished Ferdusi (Firdausi), one
of the chief glories of Persian verse. After Mahmoud&rsquo;s death, his
realm and parts of the Khalifate in turn were overrun by the Seljuk
Turks under Togrul Beg; under whose grandson Malik it was that Omar
Khayy&aacute;m, astronomer and poet, studied and sang in Khorassan. The
Turk-descended Shah favoured science as strongly as any of the
Abassides; and when he decided to reform the calendar, Omar was one of
the eight experts he employed to do it. Thus was set up for the East
the Jal&aacute;li calendar, which, as Gibbon has noted,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15314src" href="#xd25e15314" name=
"xd25e15314src">102</a> &ldquo;surpasses the Julian and approaches the
accuracy of the Gregorian style.&rdquo; Omar was, in fact, one of the
ablest mathematicians of his age.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15325src"
href="#xd25e15325" name="xd25e15325src">103</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>His name, Omar ibn Ibrahim al-Khayy&aacute;mi, seems to point to
Arab descent. &ldquo;Al-Khayy&aacute;mmi&rdquo; means &ldquo;the
tent-maker&rdquo;; but in no biographic account of him is there the
slightest proof that he or his father ever belonged to that or any
other handicraft.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15334src" href=
"#xd25e15334" name="xd25e15334src">104</a> Always he figures as a
scholar and a man of science. Since, therefore, the patronymic
al-Khayy&aacute;mi is fairly common now among Arabs, and also among the
still nomadic tribes of Khuzistan and Luristan, the reasonable
presumption is that it was in his case a patronymic also.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15337src" href="#xd25e15337" name=
"xd25e15337src">105</a> His father being a man of some substance, he
had a good schooling, and is even described in literary tradition as
having become an expert Koran scholar, by the admission of the orthodox
Al Gazzali, who, however, is represented in another record as looking
with aversion on Omar&rsquo;s scientific lore.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15343src" href="#xd25e15343" name="xd25e15343src">106</a> The
poet may have had his lead to freethought during his travels after
graduating at Naishapur, when he visited Samarkhand, Bokhara, Ispahan,
and Balk.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15348src" href="#xd25e15348" name=
"xd25e15348src">107</a> He seems to have practised astrology for a

perhaps dabbled somewhat in medicine.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15353src" href="#xd25e15353" name="xd25e15353src">108</a> A
hostile orthodox account of him, written in the thirteenth century,
represents him as &ldquo;versed in all the wisdom of the Greeks,&rdquo;
and as wont to insist on the necessity of studying science on Greek
lines.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15359src" href="#xd25e15359" name=

climatology.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15364src" href="#xd25e15364"
name="xd25e15364src">110</a></p>
<p>Beyond question the poet-astronomer was undevout; and his astronomy
doubtless helped to make him so. One contemporary writes: &ldquo;I did
not observe that he had any great belief in astrological predictions;
nor have I seen or heard of any of the great (scientists) who had such
belief.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15371src" href="#xd25e15371"
name="xd25e15371src">111</a> The biographical sketch by Ibn al Kifti,
before cited, declares that he &ldquo;performed pilgrimages not from
piety but from fear,&rdquo; having reason to dread the hostility of
contemporaries who knew or divined his unbelief; and there is a story
of a treacherous pupil who sought to bring him into public
odium.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15376src" href="#xd25e15376" name=
"xd25e15376src">112</a> In point of fact he was not, any more than
Abu&rsquo; l-Ala, a convinced atheist, but he had no sympathy with
popular religion. &ldquo;He gave his adherence to no religious sect.
Agnosticism, not faith, is the keynote of his works.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15381src" href="#xd25e15381" name=
"xd25e15381src">113</a> Among the sects he saw everywhere strife and
hatred in which he could have no part. His earlier English translators,
reflecting the tone of the first half <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>of the last century,
have thought fit to moralize censoriously over his attitude to life;
and the first, Prof. Cowell, has austerely decided that Omar&rsquo;s
gaiety is &ldquo;but a <i lang="la">risus sardonicus</i> of
despair.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15392src" href="#xd25e15392"
name="xd25e15392src">114</a> Even the subtler Fitzgerald, who has so
admirably rendered some of the audacities which Cowell thought
&ldquo;better left in the original Persian,&rdquo; has the air of
apologizing for them when he partly concurs in the same estimate. But
despair is not the name for the humorous melancholy which Omar, like
Abu&rsquo; l-Ala, weaves around his thoughts on the riddle of the
universe. Like Abu&rsquo; l-Ala, again, he talks at times of God, but
with small signs of faith. In epigrams which have seldom been surpassed
for their echoing depth, he disposes of the theistic solution and the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e15395" title="Source: lore">lure</span> of
immortality; whereafter, instead of offering another shibboleth, he
sings of wine and roses, of the joys of life and of their speedy
passage; not forgetting to add a stipulation for beneficence.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15398src" href="#xd25e15398" name=
"xd25e15398src">115</a> It was his way of turning into music the
undertone of all mortality; and that it is now preferable, for any
refined intelligence, to the affectation of zest for a
&ldquo;hereafter&rdquo; on which no one wants to enter, would seem to
be proved by the remarkable vogue he has secured in modern England,
chiefly through the incomparable version of Fitzgerald. Much of the
attraction, certainly, is due to the canorous cadence and felicitous
phrasing of those singularly fortunate stanzas; and a similar handling
might have won as high a repute among us for Abu&rsquo; l-Ala, whom, as
we have seen, some of our Orientalists set higher, and whose verse as
recently rendered into English has an indubitable charm. Fitzgerald, on
the other hand, has added much to Omar. But the thoughts of Omar remain
the kernels of Fitzgerald&rsquo;s verses; and whereas the counsel,
&ldquo;Gather ye roses while ye may,&rdquo; is common enough, it must
be the weightier bearing of his deeper and more daring ideas that gives
the quatrains their main hold to-day. In the more exact rendering of
those translators who closely reproduce the original he remains beyond
question a freethinker,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15425src" href=
"#xd25e15425" name="xd25e15425src">116</a> placing ethic above creed,
though much given to the praise of wine. Never <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=

id="xd25e15436src" href="#xd25e15436" name="xd25e15436src">117</a> he
has had in ours an unparalleled welcome; and it must be because from
his scientific vantage ground in the East, in the period of the Norman
Conquest, he had attained in some degree the vision and chimed with the
mood of a later and larger age.</p>
<p>That Omar in his day and place was not alone in his mood lies on the
face of his verse. Many quatrains ascribed to him, indeed, are
admittedly assignable to other Persian poets; and one of his English
editors notes that &ldquo;the poetry of rebellion and revolt from
orthodox opinion, which is supposed to be peculiar to him, may be
traced in the works of his predecessor Avicenna, as well as in those of
Afdal-i-K&aacute;sh&iacute;, and others of his
successors.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15444src" href=
"#xd25e15444" name="xd25e15444src">118</a> The allusions to the tavern,
a thing suspect and illicit for Islam, show that he was in a society
more Persian than Arab, one in which was to be found nearly all of the
free intellectual life possible in the Moslem East;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e15447src" href="#xd25e15447" name="xd25e15447src">119</a> and
doubtless Persian thought, always leaning to heresy, and charged with
germs of scientific speculation from immemorial antiquity, prepared his
rationalism; though his monism excludes alike dualism and theism.
&ldquo;One for two I never did misread&rdquo; is his summing up of his
philosophy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15456src" href="#xd25e15456"
name="xd25e15456src">120</a></p>
<p>But the same formula might serve for the philosophy of the sect of
Sufis,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15467src" href="#xd25e15467" name=
"xd25e15467src">121</a> who in all ages seem to have included
unbelievers as well as devoutly mystical pantheists. Founded, it is

"xd25e15473src">123</a> as from Asia. Its original doctrine of divine
love, as a reaction against Moslem austerity, gave it a fixed hold in

"#xd25e15521" name="xd25e15521src">126</a> (fl. fourteenth century), as
well as hundreds of lesser status, held under the name of Sufiism views
of life not far removed from those of Omar Khayy&aacute;m; who,
however, had bantered the Sufis so unmercifully that they are said to
have dreaded and hated him.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15527src" href=
"#xd25e15527" name="xd25e15527src">127</a> In any case, Sufiism has
included such divergent types as Al Gazzali,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15530src" href="#xd25e15530" name="xd25e15530src">128</a> the
skeptical defender of the faith; devout pantheistic poets such as
J&acirc;mi;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15534src" href="#xd25e15534"
name="xd25e15534src">129</a> and singers of love and wine such as
Hafiz, whose extremely concrete imagery is certainly not as often
allegorical as serious Sufis assert, though no doubt it is sometimes
so.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15540src" href="#xd25e15540" name=
"xd25e15540src">130</a> It even became nominally associated with the
destructive Isma&iuml;litism of the sect of the Assassins, whose
founder, Hassan, had been the schoolfellow of Omar
Khayy&aacute;m.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15546src" href="#xd25e15546"
name="xd25e15546src">131</a></p>
<p>Of Sufiism as a whole it may be said that whether as inculcating
quietism, or as widening the narrow theism of Islam into pantheism, or
as sheltering an unaggressive rationalism, it has made for freedom and
humanity in the Mohammedan world, lessening the evils of ignorance
where it could not inspire progress.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15554src" href="#xd25e15554" name="xd25e15554src">132</a> It long
anticipated the semi-rationalism of those Christians who declare heaven
and hell to be names for bodily or mental states in this life.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15560src" href="#xd25e15560" name=
"xd25e15560src">133</a> On its more philosophic side too it connects
with the long movement of speculation which, passing into European life
through the Western Saracens, revived Greek philosophic thought in
Christendom after the night of the Middle Ages, at the same time that
Saracen science passed on the more precious seeds of real knowledge to
the new civilization.</p>

the protests of orthodox apologists. Thus the Persian Al Gazzali, in
the preface to his work, <i>The Destruction of the Philosophers</i>,
declares of the subjects of his attack that &ldquo;the source of all
their errors is the trust they have in the names of Sokrates,
Hippokrates, Plato, and Aristotle; the admiration they profess for
their genius and subtlety; and the belief, finally, that those great
masters have been led by the profundity of their faculty to reject all

lost ground, its non-publication being the proof that orthodoxy
prevailed against it. Movements which were originally liberal, such as
that of the Motecallem&icirc;n, ran at length to mere dialectic defence
of the faith against the philosophers. Fighting the Aristotelian
doctrine of the eternity of matter, they sought to found a new theistic
creationism on the atoms of Demokritos, making God the creator of the
atoms, and negating the idea of natural law.<a class="noteref" id=

the Moslems. But the socio-political conditions were too unpropitious
to permit of any continuous advance on rational lines. Ere long an
uncritical orthodoxy prevailed in the Eastern schools, and it is in
Moorish Spain that we are to look for the last efforts of Arab
philosophy.</p>
<p>The course of culture-evolution there broadly corresponds with that
of the Saracen civilization in the East. In Spain the Moors came into
contact with the Roman imperial polity, and at the same time with the
different culture elements of Judaism and Christianity. To both of
these faiths they gave complete toleration, thus strengthening their
own in a way that no other policy could have availed to do. Whatever
was left of Gr&aelig;co-Roman art, handicraft, and science, saving the
arts of portraiture, they encouraged; and whatever of agricultural
science remained from Carthaginian times they zealously adopted and
improved. Like their fellow-Moslems in the East, they further learned
all the science that the preserved literature of Greece could give
them. The result was that under energetic and enlightened khalifs the
Moorish civilization became the centre of light and knowledge as well
as of material prosperity for medieval Europe. Whatever of science the
world possessed was to be found in their schools; and thither in the
tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries flocked students from the
Christian States of western and northern Europe. It was in whole or in
part from Saracen hands that the modern world received astronomy,
chemistry, mathematics, medicine, botany, jurisprudence, and
philosophy. They were, in fact, the revivers of civilization after the
age of barbarian Christianity.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15655src"
href="#xd25e15655" name="xd25e15655src">144</a> And while the
preservation of Greek science, lost from the hands of Christendom,
would have been a notable service enough, the Arabs did much more.

"pb269">269</a>]</span>abundance of practical freethought. But after a
marvellously rapid rise, the Moorish civilization was arrested and
paralysed by the internal and the external forces of
anti-civilization&mdash;religious fanaticism within and Christian
hostility without. Everywhere we have seen culture-progress depending
more or less clearly on the failure to find solutions for political
problems. The most fatal defect of all Arab civilization&mdash;a defect
involved in its first departure by way of conquest, and in its fixedly
hostile relation to the Christian States, which kept it constantly on a
military basis&mdash;was the total failure to substitute any measure of
constitutional rule for despotism. It was thus politically
unprogressive, even while advancing in other respects. But in other
respects also it soon reached the limits set by the conditions.</p>
<p>Whereas in Persia the Arabs overran an ancient civilization,
containing many elements of rationalism which acted upon their own
creed, the Moors in Spain found a population only slightly civilized,
and predisposed by its recent culture, as well as by its natural
conditions,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15703src" href="#xd25e15703"
name="xd25e15703src">147</a> to fanatical piety. Thus when, under their
tolerant rule, Jews and Christians in large numbers embraced Islam, the
new converts became the most fanatical of all.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15709src" href="#xd25e15709" name="xd25e15709src">148</a> All
rationalism existed in their despite, and, abounding as they did, they
tended to gain power whenever the Khalif was weak, and to rebel
furiously when he was hostile. When, accordingly, the growing pressure
of the feudal Christian power in Northern Spain at length became a
menacing danger to the Moorish States, weakened by endless intestine
strife, the one resource was to call in a new force of Moslem
fanaticism in the shape of the Almoravide<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15715src" href="#xd25e15715" name="xd25e15715src">149</a>
Berbers, who, to the utmost of their power, put down everything
scientific and rationalistic, and established a rigid Koranolatry.
After a time they in turn, growing degenerate while remaining orthodox,
were overrun by a new influx of conquering fanatics from Africa, the
Almohades, who, failing to add political science to their faith, went
down in the thirteenth century before the Christians in Spain, in a
great battle in which their prince sat in their sight with the Koran in
his hand.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15718src" href="#xd25e15718" name=
"xd25e15718src">150</a> Here there could be no pretence that
&ldquo;unbelief&rdquo; wrought the downfall. The Jonah of freethought,
so to speak, had been thrown overboard; and the ship went down with the
flag of faith flying at every masthead.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>It was in the last centuries of Moorish rule that there lived the
philosophers whose names connect it with the history of European
thought, retaining thus a somewhat factitious distinction as compared
with the men of science, many of them nameless, who developed and
transmitted the sciences. The pantheistic <span class=
"sc">Avempace</span> (Ibn Badja: d. 1138), who defended the reason
against the theistic skepticism of Al Gazzali,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15734src" href="#xd25e15734" name="xd25e15734src">152</a> was
physician, astronomer, and mathematician, as well as metaphysician; as
was <span class="sc">Abubacer</span> (Abu Bekr, also known as Ibn
Tophail: d. 1185), who regarded religious systems as &ldquo;only a
necessary means of discipline for the multitude,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15743src" href="#xd25e15743" name=
"xd25e15743src">153</a> and as being merely symbols of the higher truth
reached by the philosopher. Both men, however, tended rather to
mysticism than to exact thought; and Abubacer&rsquo;s treatise, <i>The
Self-taught Philosopher</i>, which has been translated into Latin (by
Pococke in 1671), English, Dutch, and German, has had the singular
fortune of being adopted by the Quakers as a work of
edification.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15753src" href="#xd25e15753"
name="xd25e15753src">154</a></p>
<p>Very different was the part played by <span class=
"sc">Averro&euml;s</span> (Ibn Roshd), the most famous of all Moslem
thinkers, because the most far-reaching in his influence on European
thought. For the Middle Ages he was pre-eminently the expounder of
Aristotle, and it is as setting forth, in that capacity, the
pantheistic doctrine which affirms the eternity of the material
universe and makes the individual soul emanate from and return to the
soul of all, that he becomes important alike in Moslem and Christian
thought. Diverging from the asceticism and mysticism of Avempace and
Abubacer, and strenuously opposing the anti-rationalism of Al Gazzali,
against whose chief treatise he penned his own <i>Destruction of the
Destruction of the Philosophers</i>, Averro&euml;s is the least
mystical and the most rational of the Arab thinkers.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e15767src" href="#xd25e15767" name="xd25e15767src">155</a> At
nearly all vital points he oppugns the religious view of things,
denying bodily resurrection, which he treats (here following all his
predecessors in heretical Arab philosophy) as a vulgar fable;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15773src" href="#xd25e15773" name=
"xd25e15773src">156</a> and making some approach to a scientific
treatment of the problem of &ldquo;Freewill&rdquo; as against, on the
one hand, the ethic-destroying doctrine of the Motecallem&icirc;n, who
made God&rsquo;s will the sole standard of right, and affirmed
predestination (Jabarism); and against, on the other hand, the
anti-determinism of the Kadarites.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15778src"
href="#xd25e15778" name="xd25e15778src">157</a> Even in his politics he
was original; and in his paraphrase of Plato&rsquo;s <i>Republic</i> he
has said a notable word for women, pointing out how small an opening is
offered for their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"

"xd25e15789src">158</a> Of all tyrannies, he boldly declared, the worst
is that of priests.</p>
<p>In time, however, a consciousness of the vital hostility of his
doctrine to current creeds, and of the danger he consequently ran, made
him, like so many of his later disciples, anxious to preserve priestly
favour. As regards religion he was more complaisant than Abubacer,
pronouncing Mohammedanism the most perfect of all popular
systems,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15797src" href="#xd25e15797" name=
"xd25e15797src">159</a> and preaching a patriotic conformity on that
score to philosophic students.</p>
<p>From him derives the formula of a two-fold truth&mdash;one truth for
science or philosophy, and another for religion&mdash;which played so
large a part in the academic life of Christendom for
centuries.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15807src" href="#xd25e15807"
name="xd25e15807src">160</a> In two of his treatises, <i>On the harmony
of religion with philosophy</i> and <i>On the demonstration of
religious dogmas</i>, he even takes up a conservative attitude,
proclaiming that the wise man never utters a word against the
established creed, and going so far as to say that the freethinker who
attacks it, inasmuch as he undermines popular virtue, deserves
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15816src" href="#xd25e15816" name=
"xd25e15816src">161</a> Even in rebutting, as entirely absurd, the
doctrine of the creation of the world, and ascribing its currency to
the stupefying power of habit, he takes occasion to remark piously that
those whose religion has no better basis than faith are frequently
seen, on taking up scientific studies, to become utter
<i>zend&#275;ks</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15826src" href=
"#xd25e15826" name="xd25e15826src">162</a> But he lived in an age of
declining culture and reviving fanaticism; and all his conformities
could not save him from proscription, at the hands of a Khalif who had
long favoured him, for the offence of cultivating Greek antiquity to
the prejudice of Islam. All study of Greek philosophy was proscribed at
the same time, and all books found on the subject were
destroyed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15831src" href="#xd25e15831"
name="xd25e15831src">163</a> Disgraced and banished from court,

<p>So complete was now the defeat of the intellectual life in Western
Islam that the ablest writer produced by the Arab race in the period of
the Renaissance, Ibn Khaldun of Tunis (1332&ndash;1406), writes as a
bigoted believer in revelation, though his writings on the science of
history were the most philosophic since the classic <span class=

<p class="first">Of later freethought under Islam there is little to
record as regards literary output, but the phenomenon has never
disappeared. Buckle, in his haste, declared that he could write the
history of Turkish civilization on the back of his hand;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15866src" href="#xd25e15866" name=
"xd25e15866src">168</a> but even in Turkey, at a time of minimum
friendly contact with other European life, there have been traces of a
spirit of freethinking nearly as active as that astir in Christendom at
the same period. Thus at the end of the seventeenth century we have
circumstantial testimony to the vogue of a doctrine of atheistic
Naturalism at Constantinople. The holders of this doctrine were called
<i>Muserin</i>, a term said to mean &ldquo;The true secret is with
us.&rdquo; They affirmed a creative and all-sustaining Nature, in which
Man has his place like the plants and like the planets; and they were
said to form a very large number, including Cadis and other learned as
well as some renegade persons.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15875src"
href="#xd25e15875" name="xd25e15875src">169</a> But Turkish
culture-conditions in the eighteenth century were not such as to permit
of intellectual progress on native lines; and to this day rationalism
in that as in other Moslem countries is mainly a matter of reflex
action set up by the impact of European scientific knowledge, or social
contact. There is no modern rationalistic literature.</p>
<p>Motazilism, so-called, is still heard of in Arabia itself.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15883src" href="#xd25e15883" name=
"xd25e15883src">170</a> In the Ottoman Empire, indeed, it is little in
evidence, standing now as it does for a species of broad-church
liberalism, analogous to Christian Unitarianism;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15892src" href="#xd25e15892" name="xd25e15892src">171</a> but in
Persia the ancient leaning to rationalism is still common. The
old-world pantheism which we have seen conserved in Omar Khayy&aacute;m
gave rise in later centuries to similar developments among the Parsees
both in Persia and in India; and from the sixteenth century onwards
there are clear traces among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href=
"#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>them of a number of rationalizing
heresies, varying from pantheism and simple deism to atheism and
materialism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15897src" href="#xd25e15897"
name="xd25e15897src">172</a> In Persia to-day there are many thinkers
of these casts of thought.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15906src" href=
"#xd25e15906" name="xd25e15906src">173</a> About 1830 a British
traveller estimated that, assuming there were between 200,000 and
300,000 Sufis in the country, those figures probably fell greatly short
of the number &ldquo;secretly inclined to infidelity.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15919src" href="#xd25e15919" name=
"xd25e15919src">174</a> Whatever be the value of the figures, the
statement is substantially confirmed by later observers;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15925src" href="#xd25e15925" name=
"xd25e15925src">175</a> missionaries reporting independently that in
Persia &ldquo;most of the higher class, of the nobility, and of the
learned professions &hellip; are at heart infidels or
sceptics.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15933src" href=
"#xd25e15933" name="xd25e15933src">176</a> Persian freethought is of
course, in large part, the freethought of ignorance, and seems to
co-exist with astrological superstition;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15945src" href="#xd25e15945" name="xd25e15945src">177</a> but
there is obviously needed only science, culture, and material
development to produce, on such a basis, a renascence as remarkable as
that of modern Japan.</p>
<p>The verdict of Vamb&eacute;ry is noteworthy: &ldquo;In all Asia,
with the exception of China, there is no land and no people wherein
there is so little of religious enthusiasm as in Persia; where
freethinkers are so little persecuted, and can express their opinions
with so little disturbance; and where, finally, as a natural
consequence, the old religious structure can be so easily shattered by
the outbreak of new enthusiasts. Whoever has read
Khayy&aacute;m&rsquo;s blasphemies against God and the prophet, his
jesting verses against the holiest ceremonies and commandments of
Islam; and whoever knows the vogue of this book and other works
directed against the current religion, will not wonder that B&acirc;b
with the weapon of the Word won so many hearts in so short a
time.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15956src" href="#xd25e15956"
name="xd25e15956src">178</a></p>
<p>The view that B&acirc;bism affiliates to rationalism is to be
understood in the sense that the atmosphere of the latter made possible
the growth of the former, its adherents being apparently drawn rather
from the former orthodox.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15967src" href=
"#xd25e15967" name="xd25e15967src">179</a> The young founder of the
sect, Mirza-Ali-Mohammed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>declared himself &ldquo;The
B&acirc;b,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;the Gate&rdquo; (to the knowledge
of God), as against the orthodox Moslem teachers who taught that
&ldquo;since the twelve Im&acirc;ms, the Gate of Knowledge is
closed.&rdquo; Hence the name of the sect. Mirza-Ali, who showed a
strong tendency to intolerance, quickly created an aggressive movement,
which was for a time put down by the killing of himself and many of his
followers.</p>
<p>Since his execution the sect has greatly multiplied and its
doctrines have much widened. For a time the founder&rsquo;s intolerant
teachings were upheld by Ez&eacute;l, the founder of one of the two
divisions into which the party speedily fell; while his rival
B&eacute;ha, who gave himself out as the true Prophet, of whom the
B&acirc;b was merely the precursor, developed a notably cosmopolitan
and equalitarian doctrine, including a vague belief in immortality,
without heaven, hell, or purgatory. Ez&eacute;l eventually abandoned
his claims, and his followers now number less than two thousand; while
the B&eacute;ha&iuml;tes number nearly three millions out of the seven
millions of the Persian population, and some two millions in the
adjacent countries. The son of B&eacute;ha, Abbas Effendi, who bears
the title of &ldquo;The Great Branch,&rdquo; now rules the cult, which
promises to be the future religion of Persia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15989src" href="#xd25e15989" name="xd25e15989src">180</a> One of
the most notable phenomena of the earlier movement was the entrance of
a young woman, daughter of a leading ulema, who for the first time in
Moslem history threw off the regulation veil and preached the equality
of the sexes.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15998src" href="#xd25e15998"
name="xd25e15998src">181</a> She was one of those first executed.
Persecution, however, has long ceased, and as a result of her lead the
position of woman in the cult is exceptionally good. Thus the last
century has witnessed within the sphere of Islam, so commonly supposed
to be impervious to change, one of the most rapid and radical religious
changes recorded in history. There is therefore no ground for holding
that in other Moslem countries progress is at an end.</p>
<p>Everything depends, broadly speaking, on the possibilities of
culture-contact. The changes in Persia are traceable to the element of
heretical habit which has persisted from pre-Moslem times; future and
more scientific development will depend upon the assimilation of
European knowledge. In Egypt, before the period of European
intervention, freethinking was at a minimum; and though toleration was
well developed as regarded Christians and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>Jews, freethinking
Moslems dared not avow themselves.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16011src"
href="#xd25e16011" name="xd25e16011src">182</a> Latterly rationalism
tends to spread in Egypt as in other Moslem countries; even under
Mohammed Ali the ruling Turks had begun to exhibit a &ldquo;remarkable
indifference to religion,&rdquo; and had &ldquo;begun to undermine the
foundations of El-Islam&rdquo;; and so shrewd and dispassionate an
observer as Lane expected that the common people would &ldquo;soon
assist in the work,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the overthrow of the whole
fabric may reasonably be expected to ensue at a period not very
remote.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16017src" href="#xd25e16017"
name="xd25e16017src">183</a> To evolve such a change there will be
required a diffusion of culture which is not at all likely to be rapid
under any Government; but in any case the ground that is being lost by
Islam in Egypt is not being retaken by Christianity.</p>
<p>In the other British dominions, Mohammedans, though less ready than
educated Hindus to accept new ideas, cannot escape the rationalizing
influence of European culture. Nor was it left to the British to
introduce the rationalistic spirit in Moslem India. At the end of the
sixteenth century the eclectic Emperor Akbar,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16024src" href="#xd25e16024" name="xd25e16024src">184</a> himself
a devout worshipper of the Sun,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16030src"
href="#xd25e16030" name="xd25e16030src">185</a> is found tolerantly
comparing all religions,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16035src" href=
"#xd25e16035" name="xd25e16035src">186</a> depreciating Islam,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e16040src" href="#xd25e16040" name=
"xd25e16040src">187</a> and arriving at such general views on the
equivalence of all creeds, and on the improbability of eternal
punishment,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16045src" href="#xd25e16045"
name="xd25e16045src">188</a> as pass for liberal among Christians in
our own day. If such views could be generated by a comparison of the
creeds of pre-British India they must needs be encouraged now. The
Mohammedan mass is of course still deeply fanatical, and habitually
superstitious; but not any more immovably so than the early Saracens.
In the eighteenth century arose the fanatical Wahabi sect, which aims
at a puritanic restoration of primeval Islam, freed from the accretions
of later belief, such as saint-worship; but the movement, though
variously estimated, has had small success, and seems destined to
extinction.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16051src" href="#xd25e16051"
name="xd25e16051src">189</a> Of the traditional seventy-three sects in
Islam only four to-day count as orthodox.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16066src" href="#xd25e16066" name="xd25e16066src">190</a></p>
<p>It may be worth while, in conclusion, to note that the comparative
prosperity or progressiveness of Islam as a proselytizing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>and
civilizing force in Africa&mdash;a phenomenon regarded even by some
Christians with satisfaction, and by some with alarm<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e16073src" href="#xd25e16073" name=
"xd25e16073src">191</a>&mdash;is not strictly or purely a religious
phenomenon. Moslem civilization suits with negro life in Africa in
virtue not of the teaching of the Koran, but of the comparative
nearness of the Arab to the barbaric life. He interbreeds with the
natives, fraternizes with them (when not engaged in kidnapping them),
and so stimulates their civilization; where the European colonist,
looking down on them as an inferior species, isolates, depresses, and
degrades them. It is thus conceivable that there is a future for Islam
at the level of a low culture-stage; but the Arab and Turkish races out
of Africa are rather the more likely to concur in the rationalistic
movement of the higher civilization.</p>
<p>Even in Africa, however, a systematic observer notes, and predicts
the extension of, &ldquo;a strong tendency on the part of the
Mohammedans towards an easy-going rationalism, such as is fast making
way in Algeria, where the townspeople and the cultivators in the more
settled districts, constantly coming in contact with Europeans, are
becoming indifferent to the more inconvenient among their Mohammedan
observances, and are content to live with little more religion than an
observance of the laws, and a desire to get on well with their
neighbours.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16090src" href=
"#xd25e16090" name="xd25e16090src">192</a> Thus at every culture-level
we see the persistence of that force of intellectual variation which is
the subject of our inquiry. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=

Sprenger (p. 43) derives the <i>Hanyfs</i> from Essenes who had almost
lost all knowledge of the Bible. Cp. p. 67. Prof. Macdonald writes that
the word &ldquo;is of very doubtful derivation. But we have evidence
from heathen Arab poetry that these <i>Hanifs</i> were regarded as much
the same as Christian monks, and that the term <i>hanif</i> was used as

Steiner, p. 8. An association called &ldquo;Brethren of Purity&rdquo;

Sale, p. 176. The same doctrine is fairly ancient in India. (Muir,

hell-fire will not be eternal was held among the Motazilite sect of
J&acirc;hedhians. Sale, p. 164. The Thamamians, again, held that at the
resurrection all infidels, idolaters, atheists, Jews, Christians,

<p class="first">It was probably from some indirect influence of the
new anti-idolatrous religion of Islam that in the eighth century the
soldier-emperor, Leo the Isaurian, known as the Iconoclast, derived his
aversion to the image-worship<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16133src"
href="#xd25e16133" name="xd25e16133src">4</a> which had long been as
general in the Christian world as ever under polytheism. So gross had
the superstition become that particular images were frequently selected
as god-parents; of others the paint was partly scratched off to be
mixed with the sacramental wine; and the bread was solemnly put in
contact with them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16151src" href=
"#xd25e16151" name="xd25e16151src">5</a> Leo began (726) by an edict
simply causing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>the images to be placed so high that they could
not be kissed, but on being met with resistance and rebellion he
ordered their total removal (730). One view is that he saw
image-worship to be the main hindrance to the spread of the faith among
Jews and Moslems, and took his measures accordingly.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e16159src" href="#xd25e16159" name="xd25e16159src">6</a> Save
on this one point he was an orthodox Christian and Trinitarian, and his
long effort to put down images and pictures was in itself rather
fanatical<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16162src" href="#xd25e16162" name=
"xd25e16162src">7</a> than rationalistic, though a measure of
freethinking was developed among the religious party he
created.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16166src" href="#xd25e16166" name=
"xd25e16166src">8</a> Of this spirit, as well as of the aversion to
image-worship,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16175src" href="#xd25e16175"
name="xd25e16175src">9</a> something must have survived the official
restoration of idolatry; but the traces are few. The most zealous
iconoclasts seem never to have risen above the flat inconsistency of
treating the cross and the written gospels with exactly the same
adoration that their opponents paid to images;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16180src" href="#xd25e16180" name="xd25e16180src">10</a> and
their appeal to the scriptures&mdash;which was their first and last
argument&mdash;was accordingly met by the retort that they themselves
accepted the authority of tradition, as did the image-worshippers. The
remarkable hostility of the army to the latter is to be explained,
apparently, by the local bias of the eastern regions from which the
soldiers were mainly recruited.</p>
<p>In the ninth century, when Saracen rivalry had stung the Byzantines
into some partial revival of culture and science,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16188src" href="#xd25e16188" name="xd25e16188src">11</a> the
all-learned Patriarch <span class="sc">Photius</span> (<i>c.</i>
820&ndash;891), who reluctantly accepted ecclesiastical office, earned
a dangerous repute for freethinking by declaring from the pulpit that
earthquakes were produced by earthly causes and not by divine
wrath.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16197src" href="#xd25e16197" name=
"xd25e16197src">12</a> But this was an almost solitary gleam of reason
in a generation wholly given up to furious strife over the worship of
images, and Photius was one of the image-worshippers. The battle swung
from extreme to extreme. The emperor Michael II, &ldquo;the
Stammerer&rdquo; (820&ndash;828), held a medium position, and
accordingly acquired the repute of a freethinker. A general under Leo
V, &ldquo;the Armenian,&rdquo; he had conspired against him, and when
on the verge of execution had been raised to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>throne in place of Leo, who was assassinated at
the altar. The new emperor aimed above all things at peace and
quietness; but his methods were thoroughly Byzantine, and included the
castration of the four sons of Leo. Michael himself is said to have
doubted the future resurrection of men, to have maintained that Judas
was saved, and to have doubted the existence of Satan because he is not
named in the Pentateuch<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16206src" href=
"#xd25e16206" name="xd25e16206src">13</a>&mdash;a species of
freethinking not far removed from that of the Iconoclasts, whose
grounds were merely Biblical. A generation later came Michael IV,
&ldquo;the Sot,&rdquo; bred a wastrel under the guardianship of his
mother, Theodora (who in 842 restored image-worship and persecuted the
Paulicians), and her brother Bardas, who ultimately put her in a
convent. Michael, repeatedly defeated by the Saracens, long held his
own at home. Taking into favour Basil, who married his
(Michael&rsquo;s) mistress, he murdered Bardas, and a year later (867)
was about to murder Basil in turn, when the latter anticipated him,
murdered the emperor, and assumed the purple. It was under Basil, who
put down the Iconoclasts, that Photius, after formally deposing and
being deposed by the Pope of Rome (864&ndash;66) was really deposed and
banished (868), to be restored to favour and office ten years later. In
886, on the death of Basil, he was again deposed, dying about 891. In
that kaleidoscope of plot and faction, fanaticism and crime, there is
small trace of sane thinking. Michael IV, in his disreputable way, was
something of a freethinker, and could even with impunity burlesque the
religious processions of the clergy,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16209src" href="#xd25e16209" name="xd25e16209src">14</a> the
orthodox populace joining in the laugh; but there was no such culture
at Constantinople as could develop a sober rationalism, or sustain it
against the clergy if it showed its head. Intelligence in general could
not rise above the plane of the wrangle over images. While the struggle
lasted, it was marked by all the ferocity that belonged from the outset
to Christian strifes; and in the end, as usual, the more irrational
bias triumphed.</p>
<p>It was in a sect whose doctrine at one point coincided with
iconoclasm that there were preserved such rude seeds of oriental
rationalism as could survive the rule of the Byzantine emperors, and
carry the stimulus of heresy to the west. The rise of the Paulicians in
Armenia dates from the seventh century, and was nominally by way of
setting up a creed on the lines of Paul as against the paganized system
of the Church. Rising as they did on the borders of Persia, they were
probably affected from the first by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>Mazdean influences,
as the dualistic principle was always affirmed by their virtual
founder, Constantine, afterwards known as Sylvanus.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e16216src" href="#xd25e16216" name="xd25e16216src">15</a> Their
original tenets seem to have been anti-Manichean, anti-Gnostic (though
partly Marcionite), opposed to the worship of images and relics, to
sacraments, to the adoration of the Virgin, of saints, and of angels,
and to the acceptance of the Old Testament; and in an age in which the
reading of the Sacred Books had already come to be regarded as a
privilege of monks and priests, they insisted on reading the New
Testament for themselves.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16225src" href=
"#xd25e16225" name="xd25e16225src">16</a> In this they were virtually
founding on the old pagan conception of religion, under which all heads
of families could offer worship and sacrifice without the intervention
of a priest, as against the Jud&aelig;o-Christian sacerdotalism, which
vetoed anything like a private <i>cultus</i>. In the teaching of
Sylvanus, further, there were distinct Manichean and Gnostic
characteristics&mdash;notably, hostility to Judaism; the denial that
Christ had a real human body, capable of suffering; and the doctrine
that baptism and the communion were properly spiritual and not physical
rites.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16246src" href="#xd25e16246" name=
"xd25e16246src">17</a> In the ninth century, when they had become a
powerful and militant sect, often at war with the empire, they were
still marked by their refusal to make any difference between priests
and laymen. Anti-ecclesiasticism was thus a main feature of the whole
movement; and the Byzantine Government, recognizing in its doctrine a
particularly dangerous heresy, had at once bloodily attacked it,
causing Sylvanus to be stoned to death.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16250src" href="#xd25e16250" name="xd25e16250src">18</a> Still it
grew, even to the length of exhibiting the usual phenomena of schism
within itself. One section obtained the protection of the first
iconoclastic emperor, who agreed with them on the subject of images;
and a later leader, Sergius or Tychicus, won similar favour from
Nicephorus I; but Leo the Armenian (suc. 813), fearing the stigma of
their other heresies, and having already trouble enough from his
iconoclasm, set up against them, as against the image-worshippers, a
new and cruel persecution.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16253src" href=

<p>Meantime those planted in Thrace, in concert with the main body,

Slavs.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16302src" href="#xd25e16302" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the west, meanwhile, where the variety of social
elements was favourable to new life, heresy of a rationalistic kind was
not wholly lacking. About the middle of the eighth century we find one
Feargal or Vergilius, an Irish priest in Bavaria, accused by St.
Boniface, his enemy, of affirming, &ldquo;in defiance of God and his
own soul,&rdquo; the doctrine of the antipodes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16361src" href="#xd25e16361" name="xd25e16361src">30</a> which
must have reached him through the ancient Greek lore carried to Ireland
in the primary period of Christianization of that province. Of that
influence we have already seen a trace in Pelagius and C&oelig;lestius;
and we shall see more later in John the Scot. After being deposed by
the Pope, Vergilius was reinstated; was made Bishop of Salzburg, and
held the post till his death; and was even sainted afterwards; but the
doctrine disappeared for centuries from the Christian world.</p>
<p>Other heresies, however, asserted themselves. Though image-worship
finally triumphed there as in the east, it had strong opponents,
notably Claudius, bishop of Turin (fl. 830) under the emperor Louis the
Pious, son of Charlemagne, and his contemporary Agobard, bishop of
Lyons.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16375src" href="#xd25e16375" name=
"xd25e16375src">31</a> It is a significant fact that both men were born
in Spain; and either to Saracen or to Jewish influence&mdash;the latter
being then strong in the Moorish and even in the Christian<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e16387src" href="#xd25e16387" name=
"xd25e16387src">32</a> world&mdash;may fairly be in part attributed
their marked bias against image-worship. Claudius was slightly and
Agobard well educated in Latin letters, so that an early
impression<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16393src" href="#xd25e16393"
name="xd25e16393src">33</a> would seem to have been at work in both
cases. However that may be, they stood out as singularly rationalistic
theologians in an age of general ignorance and superstition. Claudius
vehemently resisted alike image-worship, saint-worship, and the Papal
claims, and is recorded to have termed a council of bishops which
condemned him &ldquo;an assembly of asses.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16396src" href="#xd25e16396" name="xd25e16396src">34</a> Agobard,
in turn, is quite extraordinary in the thoroughness of his rejection of
popular superstition, being not only an iconoclast but an enemy to
prayer for change in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href=

battle,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16405src" href="#xd25e16405" name=
"xd25e16405src">35</a> and to the belief in the verbal inspiration of
the Sacred Books. In an age of enormous superstition and deep
ignorance, he maintained within the Church that Reason was the noble
gift of God.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16417src" href="#xd25e16417"

<p>A grain of rationalism, as apart from professional self-interest,
may also have entered into the outcry made at this period by the clergy
against the rigidly predestinarian doctrine of the monk
Gottschalk.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16436src" href="#xd25e16436"
name="xd25e16436src">38</a> His enemy, Rabanus or Hrabanus (called
&ldquo;the Moor&rdquo;), seems again to represent some Saracen
influence, inasmuch as he reproduced the scientific lore of Isidore of
Seville.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16439src" href="#xd25e16439" name=
"xd25e16439src">39</a> But the philosophic semi-rationalism of
<span class="sc">John Scotus</span> (d. 875), later known as Erigena
(John the Scot = of Ireland&mdash;the original &ldquo;Scots&rdquo;
being Irish), seems to be traceable to the Greek studies which had been
cherished in Christianized Ireland while the rest of western Europe
lost them, and represents at once the imperfect beginning of the
relatively rationalistic philosophy of Nominalism<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16451src" href="#xd25e16451" name="xd25e16451src">40</a> and the
first western revival of the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, howbeit
by way of accommodation to the doctrine of the Church.<a class=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">That John the Scot was an Irishman remains practically
certain, even if we give up the term &ldquo;Erigena,&rdquo; which, as
has been shown by Floss, the most careful editor of his works, is not
found in the oldest MSS. The reading there is Ierugena, which later
shades into Erugena and Eriugena. (Cp. Ueberweg, i, 359; Poole, pp.
55&ndash;56, <i>note</i>; Dr. Th. Christlieb, <i lang="de">Leben und
Lehre des Johannes Scotus Erigena</i>, 1860, p. 14 <i>sq.</i>; and
Huber, <i lang="de">Johannes Scotus Erigena: ein Beitrag zur Geschichte
der Philosophie und Theologie im Mittelalter</i>, 1861, pp.
38&ndash;40.) From this elusive cognomen no certain inference can be
drawn, too many being open; though the fact that John had himself
coined the term <i>Graiugena</i> for a late Greek writer makes it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>likely that he called himself <i>Ierugena</i> in
the sense of &ldquo;born in the holy (island)&rdquo; = Ireland. But the
name Scotus, occurring <i>without</i> the Ierugena, is common in old
MSS.; and it is almost impossible that any save a Scot of Ireland
should have possessed the scholarship of John in the ninth century. In
the west, Greek scholarship and philosophy had been special to Ireland
from the time of Pelagius; and it is from Greek sources that John draws
his inspiration and cast of thought. M. Taillandier not unjustly calls
the Ireland of that era &ldquo;<span lang="fr">l&rsquo;&icirc;le des
saints, mais aussi l&rsquo;&icirc;le des libres penseurs</span>.&rdquo;
(<i lang="fr">Scot &Eacute;rig&egrave;ne et la philosophie
scolastique</i>, 1843, p. 64.) To the same effect Huber, pp.
40&ndash;41. In writing that Johannes &ldquo;was of Scottish
nationality, but was probably born and brought up in Ireland,&rdquo;
Ueberweg (i, 358) obscures the fact that the people of Ireland
<i>were</i> the Scoti of that period. All the testimony goes to show
&ldquo;that Ireland was called <i>Scotia</i>, and its ruling people
<i>Scoti</i>, from the first appearance of these names down to the
eleventh century. But that [the] present Scotland was called
<i>Scotia</i>, or its people <i>Scoti</i>, before the eleventh century,
not so much as <i>one</i> single authority can be produced&rdquo;
(Pinkerton, <i>Enquiry into the History of Scotland</i>, 1789, ii,
237). Irish Scots gave their name to Scotland, and it was adopted by
the Teutonic settlers.</p>
<p>While the land of John the Scot&rsquo;s birth is thus fairly
certain, the place of his death remains a mystery. Out of a statement
by Asser that King Alfred made one John, a priest, Abbot of Athelney,
and that the said Abbot was murdered at the altar by hired assassins,
there grew a later story that Alfred made John <i>the Scot</i> Abbot of
Malmesbury, and that <i>he</i> was slain with the <i>styli</i> of two
of his pupils. It is clear that the John of Asser was an &ldquo;Old
Saxon,&rdquo; and not the philosopher; and it is difficult to doubt
that the second story, which arises in the twelfth century, is a
hearsay distortion of the first. Cp. Christlieb, who argues (p. 42
<i>sq.</i>) for two Johns, one of them Scotus, and both assassinated,
with Huber, who sets forth (p. 108 <i>sq.</i>) the view here followed.
There is really no adequate ground for believing that John the Scot was
ever a priest. We know not where or when he died; but the presumption
is that it was in France, and not long after the death of his patron
Charles&mdash;877. (Huber, p. 121.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Called in by Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims, himself a normally
superstitious believer,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16545src" href=
"#xd25e16545" name="xd25e16545src">42</a> to answer Gottschalk, John
Scotus in turn was accused of heresy, as he well might be on many
points of his treatise, <i lang="la">De Praedestinatione</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e16550src" href="#xd25e16550" name=
"xd25e16550src">43</a> (851). He fiercely and not very <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>fairly condemned Gottschalk as a heretic,
charging him with denying both divine grace and freewill, but without
disposing of Gottschalk&rsquo;s positive grounds; and arguing that God
could not be the cause of sin, as if Gottschalk had not said the same
thing. His superior speculative power comes out in his undertaking to
show that for the Divine Being sin is <i>non-ens</i>; and that
therefore that Being cannot properly be said either to foreknow or to
predestinate, or to punish. But the argument becomes inconsistent
inasmuch as it further affirms Deity to have so constituted the order
of things that sin punishes itself.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16561src" href="#xd25e16561" name="xd25e16561src">44</a> It is
evident that in assimilating his pantheistic conceptions he had failed
to think out their incompatibility with any theistic dogma whatever;
his reasoning, on the whole, being no more coherent than
Gottschalk&rsquo;s. He had in fact set out from an arbitrary theistic
position that was at once Judaic, Christian, and Platonic, and went
back on one line to the Gnostics; while on another his argument that
sin has no real existence is a variant from an old thesis&mdash;made
current, as we saw, by Euclides of Megara&mdash;with which orthodoxy
had met the Manicheans.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16567src" href=
"#xd25e16567" name="xd25e16567src">45</a> But to the abstract doctrine
he gave a new practical point by declaring that the doctrine of
hell-fire was a mere allegory; that heaven and hell alike were states
of consciousness, not places.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16579src"
href="#xd25e16579" name="xd25e16579src">46</a> And if such concrete
freethinking were not enough to infuriate the orthodox, they had from
him the most explicit declarations that authority is derivable solely
from reason.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16587src" href="#xd25e16587"
name="xd25e16587src">47</a></p>
<p>In philosophy proper he must be credited, despite his inconsistency,
with deep and original thought.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16598src"
href="#xd25e16598" name="xd25e16598src">48</a> Like every theologian of
philosophic capacity before and since, he passes into pantheism as soon
as he grapples closely with the difficulties of theism, and &ldquo;the
expressions which he uses are identical with those which were
afterwards employed by Spinoza&#8202;&hellip;. It was a tradition of
the fourth or fifth century transferred to the ninth, an echo from
Alexandria.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16601src" href=

availed to keep that echo audible to later centuries.</p>
<p>The range and vigour of his practical rationalism may be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>gathered from his attitude in the controversy
begun by the abbot Paschasius Radbert (831) on the nature of the
Eucharist. Paschasius taught that there was a real transformation of
the bread and wine into the divine body and blood; and the doctrine,
thus nakedly put, startled the freer scholars of the time, who were not
yet habituated to Latin orthodoxy. Another learned monk, Ratramnus, who
had written a treatise on predestination at the request of the
rationalizing emperor, Charles the Bald (discussing the problem in
Gottschalk&rsquo;s sense<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16614src" href=
"#xd25e16614" name="xd25e16614src">51</a> without naming him), produced
on the same monarch&rsquo;s invitation a treatise in which
transubstantiation was denied, and the &ldquo;real presence&rdquo; was
declared to be spiritual<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16620src" href=
"#xd25e16620" name="xd25e16620src">52</a>&mdash;a view already known to
Paschasius as being held by some.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16625src"
href="#xd25e16625" name="xd25e16625src">53</a> John Scotus, also asked
by the emperor to write on the subject, went so far as to argue that
the bread and wine were merely symbols and memorials.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e16631src" href="#xd25e16631" name="xd25e16631src">54</a> As
usual, the irrational doctrine became that of the Church;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e16635src" href="#xd25e16635" name=
"xd25e16635src">55</a> but the other must have wrought for reason in
secret. For the rest, he set forth the old &ldquo;modal&rdquo; view of
the Trinity, resolving it into the different conceptual aspects of the
universe, and thus propounding one more vital heresy.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e16638src" href="#xd25e16638" name="xd25e16638src">56</a></p>
<p>Nothing but a succession of rationalizing emperors could have
secured continuance for such teaching as that of Ratramnus and John the
Scot. For a time, the cruelty meted out to Gottschalk kept up feeling
in favour of his views; Bishop Remigius of Lyons condemned
Hincmar&rsquo;s treatment of him; and others sought to maintain his
positions, with modifications, though Hincmar carried resolutions
condemning them at the second Synod of Chiersy. On the other hand,
Archbishop Wenilo of Sens, Bishop Prudentius of Troyes, and Florus, a
deacon of Lyons, all wrote against the doctrines of John the Scot; and
the second Synod of Valence (855), while opposing Hincmar and affirming
duplex predestination, denounced with fury the reasonings of John the
Scot, ascribing them to his nation as a whole.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16643src" href="#xd25e16643" name="xd25e16643src">57</a> The pope
taking the same line, the fortunes of the rationalistic view of the
eucharist and of hell-fire were soon determined for the Middle Ages,
though in the year 950 we find the Archbishop of Canterbury confronted
by English ecclesiastics who asserted that there was no
transubstantiation, the elements being merely a figure of the body and
blood of Christ.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16652src" href=
"#xd25e16652" name="xd25e16652src">58</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>The economic explanation clearly holds alike as regards the attack
on John and the condemnation of Gottschalk for a doctrine which had
actually been established for centuries, on the authority of Augustine,
as strict orthodoxy. In Augustine&rsquo;s time, the determining
pressures were not economic: a bankrupt world was seeking to explain
its fate; and Augustine had merely carried a majority with him against
Pelagius, partly by his personal influence, partly by force of the
fatalist mood of the time. But in the renascent world of
Gottschalk&rsquo;s day the economic exploitation of fear had been
carried several stages forward by the Church; and the question of
predestination had a very direct financial bearing. The northern
peoples, accustomed to compound for crimes by money payments, had so
readily played into the hands of the priesthood by their eagerness to
buy surcease of purgatorial pain that masses for the dead and
&ldquo;penitential certificates&rdquo; were main sources of
ecclesiastical revenue. Therefore the condemnations of such abuses
passed by the Councils, on the urging of the more thoughtful clergy,
were constantly frustrated by the plain pecuniary interest of the
priests.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16661src" href="#xd25e16661" name=
"xd25e16661src">59</a> It even appears that the eucharist was popularly
regarded not as a process of religious &ldquo;communion,&rdquo; but as
a magical rite objectively efficacious for bodily preservation in this
life and the next. Thus it came about that often &ldquo;priests
presented the offering of the mass alone and by themselves, without any
participation of the congregation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16667src" href="#xd25e16667" name="xd25e16667src">60</a></p>
<p>If then it were to be seriously understood that the future lot of
all was foreordained, all expenditure on masses for the dead, or to
secure in advance a lightening of purgatorial penance, or even to buy
off penance on earth, was so much waste; and the Teutons were still as
ready as other barbarians to make their transactions with Church, God,
and the saints a matter of explicit bargain.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16675src" href="#xd25e16675" name="xd25e16675src">61</a>
Gottschalk, accordingly, had to be put down, in the general interests
of the Church. It could not truthfully be pretended that he deviated
from Augustine, for he actually held by the &ldquo;semi-Pelagian&rdquo;
inconsistency that God predestinates good, but merely foreknows
evil.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16681src" href="#xd25e16681" name=
"xd25e16681src">62</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=
"#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>There was in fact no clear
opposition between his affirmations and those of Rabanus Maurus, who
also professed to be an Augustinian; but the latter laid forensic
stress on the &ldquo;desire&rdquo; of God that all men should be saved,
and on the formula that Christ died for all; while Gottschalk, more
honestly, insisted that predestination is predestination, and applied
the principle not merely, as had been customary, to the future state of
the good, but to that of the bad,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16689src"
href="#xd25e16689" name="xd25e16689src">63</a> insisting on a <i lang=
"la">pr&aelig;destinatio duplex</i>. His own fate was thus economically
predestinate; and he was actually tortured by the scourge till he cast
into the fire his written defence, &ldquo;a document which contained
nothing but a compilation of testimonies from Scripture, and from the
older church-teachers.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16702src"
href="#xd25e16702" name="xd25e16702src">64</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Gottschalk later challenged a fourfold ordeal of
&ldquo;boiling water, oil, and pitch.&rdquo; His primary doctrine had
been the immutability of the divine will; but he brought himself to the
belief that God would work a miracle in his favour. His conception of
&ldquo;foreordination&rdquo; was thus framed solely with regard to the
conception of a future state. The ordeal was not granted, the orthodox
party fearing to try conclusions, and he died without the sacraments,
rather than recant. Then began the second reaction of feeling against
his chief persecutor, Hincmar. Neander, vi, 190.</p>
<p>A recent writer, who handles very intelligently and temperately the
problem of persecution, urges that in that connection &ldquo;one ought
not to lay great stress on the old argument of the Hallam and Macaulay
school as to the strength of vested interests, though it has a certain
historical importance, because the priest must subsist somehow&rdquo;
(<i>Religious Persecution: a Study in Psychology</i>, by E. S. P.
Haynes, 1904, p. 4). If the &ldquo;certain importance&rdquo; be in the
ratio of the certainty of the last adduced fact, the legitimate
&ldquo;stress&rdquo; on the argument in question would seem sufficient
for most purposes. The writer adds the note: &ldquo;It is not unfair,
however, to quote the case of Dr. Middleton, who, writing to Lord
Radnor in 1750 in respect of his famous work on Miracles, admits
frankly enough that he would never have given the clergy any trouble,
had he received some good appointment in the church.&rdquo; If the
essayist has met with no other historic fact illustrative of the play
of vested interests in ecclesiastical history, it is extremely candid
of him to mention that one. Later on, however, he commits himself to
the proposition that &ldquo;the history of medieval persecution leads
one to infer that the clergy as a whole were roused to much
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>greater activity by menaces to their material
comforts in this world than by an altruistic anxiety for the fate of
lay souls in the next&rdquo; (<i>id.</i> p. 60. Cp. p. 63). This amount
of &ldquo;stress&rdquo; on vested interests will probably satisfy most
members of the Hallam and Macaulay school; and is ample for the
purposes of the present contention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this point onward, the slow movement of new ideas may for a
time be conveniently traced on two general lines&mdash;one that of the
philosophic discussion in the schools, reinforced by Saracen
influences, the other that of partially rationalistic and democratic
heresy among the common people, by way first of contagion from the
East. The latter was on the whole as influential for sane thought as
the former, apart from such ecclesiastical freethinking as that of
Berengar of Tours and Roscelin (Rousselin), Canon of Compi&egrave;gne.
Berengar (<i>c.</i> 1050) was led by moral reflection<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e16730src" href="#xd25e16730" name="xd25e16730src">65</a> to
doubt the priestly miracle of the Eucharist, and thenceforth he entered
into a stormy controversy on the subject, in the course of which he
twice recanted under bodily fear, but passionately returned to his
original positions. Fundamentally sincere, and indignantly resentful of
the gross superstition prevailing in the Church, he struck fiercely in
his writings at Popes Leo IX and Nicholas II and Archbishop
Lanfranc,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16735src" href="#xd25e16735" name=
"xd25e16735src">66</a> all of whom had opposed him. At length, after
much strife, he threw up the contest, spending the latter part of his
long life in seclusion; Pope Gregory VII, who was personally friendly
to him, having finally shielded him from persecution. It seems clear
that, though accused, with others of his school, of rejecting certain
of the gospel miracles,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16738src" href=
"#xd25e16738" name="xd25e16738src">67</a> he never became a
disbeliever; his very polemic testifying to the warmth of his belief on
his own lines. His teaching, however, which went far by reason of the
vividness of his style, doubtless had the effect of promoting not only
the rationalistic-Christian view of the Eucharist,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e16743src" href="#xd25e16743" name="xd25e16743src">68</a> but a
criticism which went further, inasmuch as his opponents forced on the
bystanders the question as to what reality there was in the Christian
creed if his view were true.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16749src" href=
"#xd25e16749" name="xd25e16749src">69</a> All such influences, however,
were but slight in total mass compared with the overwhelming weight of
the economic interest of the priesthood; and not till the Reformation
was Berengar&rsquo;s doctrine accepted by a single organized sect. The
orthodox doctrine, in fact, was all-essential to the Catholic Church.
Given the daily miracle of the &ldquo;real presence,&rdquo; the Church
had a vital hold on the Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290"
href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>world, and the priest was
above all lay rivalry. Seeing as much, the Council of the Lateran
(1059) met the new criticism by establishing the technical doctrine of
the real presence for the first time as an article of faith; and as
such it will doubtless stand while there is a Catholic priesthood.
Berengar&rsquo;s original view must have been shared by thousands; but
no Catholic carried on his propaganda. The question had become one of
life and death.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Berengar&rsquo;s forced prevarications, which are
unsympathetically set forth by Mosheim (11 Cent., pt. ii, ch. iii,
&sect;&sect; 13&ndash;18), are made much more intelligible in the
sympathetic survey of Neander (vi, 225&ndash;60). See also the careful
inquiry of Reuter, <i lang="de">Gesch. der religi&ouml;sen
Aufkl&auml;rung im Mittelalter</i>, i, 91 <i>sq.</i> As to
Berengar&rsquo;s writings, see further Murdock&rsquo;s note to Mosheim,
last cit., &sect; 18. The formal compromise forced on him by Pope
Hildebrand, who was personally friendly to him, consisted in adding to
his denial of the change of the bread and wine into &ldquo;body and
blood&rdquo; the doctrine that the body and blood were
&ldquo;superadded to the bread and wine in and by their
consecration.&rdquo; This formula, of course, did not represent the
spirit of Berengar&rsquo;s polemic. As to the disputes on the subject,
which ran to the most unseemly length of physiological detail, see
Voltaire, <i lang="fr">Essai sur les M&oelig;urs</i>, ch. xlv. It is
noteworthy that Augustine had very expressly set forth a metaphorical
interpretation of the Eucharist&mdash;<i lang="la">De doctrina
christiana</i>, l. iii, c. 16. But just as the Church later set aside
the verdict of Thomas Aquinas that the Virgin Mary was &ldquo;born in
sin,&rdquo; so did it reverse Augustine&rsquo;s judgment on the
Eucharist. Always the more irrational view carried the day, as being
more propitious to sacerdotal claims.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So far as the Church by her keenly self-regarding organization could
attain it, all opinion was kept within the strict bounds of her
official dogma, in which life in the Middle Ages so long stagnated. For
centuries, despite the turmoil of many wars&mdash;which, indeed, helped
to arrest thought&mdash;the life of the mind presented a uniformity
hardly now conceivable. The common expectation of the ending of the
world, in the year 1000, in particular had an immense prepotency of
paralysing men&rsquo;s spirits; and the grooves of habit thus fixed
were hard to alter. For most men, the notion of possible innovation in
thought did not exist: the usual was the sacred: the very ideal of an
improvement or reformation, when it arose, was one of reaching back to
a far-away perfection of the past, never of remoulding things on lines
laid down by reason. Yet even into this half-stifled world there
entered, by eastern ways, and first in the guise of rude demotic
departures from priestly prescription, the indestructible spirit of
change. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first Western traces of the imported Paulician
heresy are about the year 1000,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16787src"
href="#xd25e16787" name="xd25e16787src">70</a> when a rustic of
Ch&acirc;lons is heard of as destroying a cross and a religious
picture, and asserting that the prophets are not wholly to be
believed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16790src" href="#xd25e16790" name=
"xd25e16790src">71</a> From this time forward, the world having begun
to breathe again after the passing of the year 1000 without any sign of
the Day of Judgment, heresy begins to multiply, the chief movers being
&ldquo;distinguished by a tendency to rationalism.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e16796src" href="#xd25e16796" name=
"xd25e16796src">72</a> In 1010 there is <span class="corr" id=

Aquitaine.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16802src" href="#xd25e16802"
name="xd25e16802src">73</a> In the year 1022 (or, as the date is
sometimes put, in 1017) we hear of the unveiling of a secret society of
rationalizing mystics at Orleans, ten canons of one church being
members.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16809src" href="#xd25e16809" name=
"xd25e16809src">74</a> An Italian woman was said to be the founder, and
thirteen were burned alive on their refusal to recant. According to the
records, they denied all miracles, including the Virgin Birth and the
Resurrection; rejected baptism and the miracle of the Eucharist; took
the old &ldquo;Docetic&rdquo; view of Jesus, denying his actual
humanity; and affirmed the eternity of matter and the non-creation of
the world. They were also accused, like the first Christians, of
promiscuous nocturnal orgies and of eating sacrificed infants; but
unless such charges are to be held valid in the other case, they cannot
be here.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16836src" href="#xd25e16836" name=
"xd25e16836src">75</a> The stories told of the Manichean community who
lived in the castle of Monforte, near Asti in Lombardy, in the years
1025&ndash;1040, and who at length were likewise burned alive, are
similarly mixed with fable.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16845src" href=
"#xd25e16845" name="xd25e16845src">76</a> On this case it is recorded
that, while the Archbishop of Milan investigated the heresy, the
burning of the victims was the work of the fanatical populace of Milan,
and was done against his will.</p>
<p>A less savage treatment may have made possible the alleged success
of Gerhard, bishop of Cambray and Arras, in reconciling to the Church
at Arras, in 1025 or 1030, a number of laymen&mdash;also said to have
been taught by an Italian&mdash;who as a body rejected all external
worship, setting aside priestly baptism and the sacraments, penance and
images, funeral rites, holy oil, church bells, cross-worship,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>altars, and even churches, and denied the
necessity of an order of priests.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16852src"
href="#xd25e16852" name="xd25e16852src">77</a> Few of the Protestants
of a later age were so thorough-going; but the fact that many of the
sect stood to the old Marcionite veto on marriage and the sexual
instinct gives to their propaganda its own cast of fanaticism. This
last tenet it seemingly was that gave the Paulicians their common Greek
name of <i>cathari</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16858src" href=
"#xd25e16858" name="xd25e16858src">78</a> &ldquo;the pure,&rdquo;
corrupted or assimilated in Italian to <i>gazzari</i>, whence
presumably the German word for heretic, <i>Ketzer</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e16868src" href="#xd25e16868" name=
"xd25e16868src">79</a> Such a doctrine had the double misfortune that
if acted on it left the sect without the normal recruitment of
members&rsquo; children, while if departed from it brought on them the
stigma of wanton hypocrisy; and as a matter of fact every movement of
the kind, ancient and modern, seems to have contained within it the two
extremes of asceticism and licence, the former generating the
latter.</p>
<p>It could hardly, however, have been the ascetic doctrine that won
for the new heresy its vogue in medieval Europe; nor is it likely that
the majority of the heretics even professed it. If, on the other hand,
we ask how it was that in an age of dense superstition so many
uneducated people were found to reject so promptly the most sacrosanct
doctrines of the Church, it seems hardly less difficult to account for
the phenomenon on the bare ground of their common sense. Critical
common sense there must have been, to allow of it at all; but it is
reasonable to suppose that then, as clearly happened later at the
Reformation, common sense had a powerful stimulus in pecuniary
interest.</p>
<p>With the evidence as to Christian practice in the fourth century on
the one hand, and the later evidence as to clerical life on the other,
we are certain of a common play of financial motive throughout the
Middle Ages. And whereas it is intelligible that such rapacity as we
have seen described by Libanius should evoke a heresy which rejected
alike religious ceremonial and the claims of the priest, it is further
reasonable to surmise that resentment of priestly rapacity and luxury
helped men to similar heresy in Western Europe when the doctrine
reached them. If any centuries are to be singled out as those of
maximum profligacy and extortion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293"
href="#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>among the clergy, they are
the ninth and the three following.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16896src"
href="#xd25e16896" name="xd25e16896src">80</a> It had been part of the
policy of Charlemagne everywhere to strengthen the hands of the clergy
by way of checking the power of the nobles;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16908src" href="#xd25e16908" name="xd25e16908src">81</a> and in
the disorder after his death the conflicting forces were in
semi-anarchic competition. The feudal habit of appointing younger sons
and underlings to livings wherever possible; the disorders and strifes
of the papacy; and the frequent practice of dispossessing priests to
reward retainers, thereby driving the dispossessed to plunder on their
own account, must together have created a state of things almost past
exaggeration. It was a matter of course that the clergy on their part
should make the utmost possible use of their influence over men&rsquo;s
superstitious fears in order to acquire bequests of lands;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e16917src" href="#xd25e16917" name=
"xd25e16917src">82</a> and such bequests in turn exasperated the heirs
thus disinherited.</p>
<p>Thus orthodoxy and heterodoxy alike had strong economic motives; and
in these may be placed a main part of the explanation of the gross
savagery of persecution now normal in the Church. Such a heresy as that
of Gottschalk, we saw, by denying to the priest all power of affecting
the predestined course of things here or hereafter, logically
imperilled the very existence of the whole hierarchy, and was by many
resented accordingly. The same principle entered into the controversies
over the Eucharist. Still more would the clergy resent the new
Manichean heresy, of which every element, from the Euchite tenet of the
necessity of personal prayer and mortification, as against the innate
demon, to the rejection of all the rites of normal worship and all the
pretensions of priests, was radically hostile to the entire
organization of the Church. When the heretics in due course developed a
priestly system of their own,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16925src"
href="#xd25e16925" name="xd25e16925src">83</a> the hostility was only
the more embittered.</p>
<p>The crisis was the more acute, finally, because in the latter part
of the tenth century the common expectation that the world would end
with the year 1000 had inspired enormous donations to the
Church,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16930src" href="#xd25e16930" name=
"xd25e16930src">84</a> with a proportionally oppressive effect on the
general population, moving them to economic self-defence. It is in fact
clear that an anti-clerical element entered largely into the beginnings
of the communal movement in France in the eleventh century. In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>1024 we find the citizens of Cambrai forming a
league to drive out the canons;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16938src"
href="#xd25e16938" name="xd25e16938src">85</a> and though that
beginning of revolt was crushed out by massacre, the same spirit
expressed itself in heresy. The result was that religious persecution
ere long eclipsed political. Bishop Wazon of L&uuml;ttich (d. 1048) in
vain protested against the universal practice of putting the heretics
to death.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16944src" href="#xd25e16944" name=
"xd25e16944src">86</a> Manicheans who were detected in 1052 at Goslar,
in Germany, were hanged,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16950src" href=
"#xd25e16950" name="xd25e16950src">87</a> a precedent being thus
established in the day of small things.</p>
<p>All this went on while the course of the papacy was so scandalous to
the least exacting moral sense that only the ignorance of the era could
sustain any measure of reverence for the Church as an institution. In
the year 963 the ablest of the emperors of that age, Otto the Great,
had the consent of the people of Rome to his deposition of Pope John
XII, a disorderly youth of twenty-five, &ldquo;the most profligate if
not the most guilty of all who have worn the tiara,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e16960src" href="#xd25e16960" name=
"xd25e16960src">88</a> and to his appointing the Pope in future; but
Teutonic administration soon drove the populace to repeated revolt,
quenched by massacre, till at length John returned, speedily to be
slain by a wronged husband. Economic interest entered largely into the
subsequent attempts of the Romans to choose their own Pope and rule
their own city, and into the contrary claim of the emperors to do both;
and in the nature of things the usually absent emperors could only
spasmodically carry their point. The result was an epoch of riotous
disorder in the papacy. Between John and Leo IX (955&ndash;1048) six
popes were deposed, two murdered, and one mutilated;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e16969src" href="#xd25e16969" name="xd25e16969src">89</a> and
the Church was a mere battle-ground of the factions of the Roman and
Italian nobility.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16975src" href=
"#xd25e16975" name="xd25e16975src">90</a> At last, in 1047, &ldquo;a
disgraceful contest between three claimants of the papal chair shocked
even the reckless apathy of Italy&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e16981src" href="#xd25e16981" name="xd25e16981src">91</a> and the
emperor Henry III deposed them all and appointed a pope of his own
choosing, the clergy again consenting. Soon, however, as before, the
local claim was revived; and in the papacy of the powerful Gregory VII,
known as Hildebrand, the head of the Church determinedly asserted its
autonomy and his own autocracy. Then came the long &ldquo;war of the
investitures&rdquo; between the popes and the emperors, in which the
former were substantially the gainers. The result was, in addition
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>to the endless miseries set up by war, a
systematic development of that financial corruption which already had
been scandalous enough. The cathedral chapters and the nobles traded in
bishoprics; the popes sold their ratifications for great sums; the
money was normally borrowed by the bishops from the papal usurers; and
there was witnessed throughout Europe the spectacle of the Church
denouncing all usury as sin, while its own usurers were scrupulously
protected, the bishops paying to them their interest from the revenues
they were able to extort.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16987src" href=
"#xd25e16987" name="xd25e16987src">92</a> Satirical comment naturally
abounded wherever men had any knowledge of the facts; and what current
literature there was reflected the feeling on all sides.</p>
<p>The occurrence of the first and second crusades, the work
respectively of Peter the Hermit and St. Bernard, created a period of
new fanaticism, somewhat unfavourable to heresy; but even in that
period the new sects were at work,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e16995src"
href="#xd25e16995" name="xd25e16995src">93</a> and in the twelfth
century, when crusading had become a mere feudal conspiracy of conquest
and plunder,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17001src" href="#xd25e17001"
name="xd25e17001src">94</a> heresy reappeared, to be duly met by
slaughter. A perfect ferment of anti-clerical heresy had arisen in
Italy, France, and Flanders.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17007src" href=
"#xd25e17007" name="xd25e17007src">95</a> At Orvieto, in Italy, the
heretics for a time actually had the mastery, and were put down only
after a bloody struggle.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17010src" href=
"#xd25e17010" name="xd25e17010src">96</a> In France, for a period of
twenty years from 1106, Peter de Brueys opposed infant baptism, the use
of churches, holy crosses, prayers for the dead (the great source of
clerical income), and the doctrine of the Real Presence in the
eucharist (the main source of their power), and so set up the highly
heretical sect of Petrobrussians.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17015src"
href="#xd25e17015" name="xd25e17015src">97</a> Driven from his native
district of Vallonise, he long maintained himself in Gascony, till at
length he was seized and burned (1126 or 1130). The monk Henry (died in
prison 1148) took a similar line, directly denouncing the clergy in
Switzerland and France; as did Tanquelin in Flanders (killed by a
priest, 1125); though in his case there seems to have been as much of
religious hallucination as of the contrary.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17022src" href="#xd25e17022" name="xd25e17022src">98</a> A
peasant, Eudo of Stella (who died in prison), is said to have
half-revolutionized Brittany with his anti-ecclesiastical
preaching.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17028src" href="#xd25e17028"
name="xd25e17028src">99</a> The more famous monk Arnold of Brescia
(strangled and burned in 1155), a pupil of Abailard, but orthodox in
his theology and austere in his life, simplified his plan of reform
(about 1139) into a proposal that the whole wealth of the clergy, from
the pope <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>to the monks, should be transferred to the civil
power, leaving churchmen to lead a spiritual life on voluntary
offerings.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17036src" href="#xd25e17036"
name="xd25e17036src">100</a> For fifteen years the stir of his movement
lasted in Lombardy, till at length his formation of a republic at Rome
forced the papacy to combine with the Emperor Frederick II, who gave
Arnold up to death. But though his movement perished, anti-clericalism
did not; and heretical sects of some kind persisted here and there, in
despite of the Church, till the age of the Reformation. In Italy,
during the age of the Renaissance, all alike were commonly called
<i lang="it">paterini</i> or <i lang="it">patarini</i>&mdash;a nickname
which seems to come from <i lang="it">pataria</i>, a Milanese word
meaning &ldquo;popular faction&rdquo; or
&ldquo;rowdies.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17049src" href=
"#xd25e17049" name="xd25e17049src">101</a> Thus in the whole movement
of fresh popular thought there is a manifest connection with the
democratic movement in politics, though in the schools the spirit of
discussion and dialectic had no similar relationship.</p>
<p>During the first half of the century its warfare with the emperors,
and the frequent appointment of anti-popes, prevented any systematic
policy on the part of the Holy See,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17069src" href="#xd25e17069" name="xd25e17069src">102</a>
repression being mostly left to the local ecclesiastical authorities.
It was in 1139 that Innocent II issued the first papal decree against
Cathari, expelling them from the Church and calling on the temporal
power to give full effect to their excommunication.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e17072src" href="#xd25e17072" name="xd25e17072src">103</a> In
1163 Pope Alexander III, being exiled from Rome by Frederick I and the
anti-pope Victor, called a great council at Tours, where again a policy
of excommunication was decided on, the secular authorities being
commanded to imprison the excommunicated and confiscate their property,
but not to slay them. In the same year some Cathari arrested at Cologne
had been sentenced to be burned; but the Council did not go so far. As
a result the decree had little or no effect.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17077src" href="#xd25e17077" name="xd25e17077src">104</a></p>
<p>So powerless was the Church at this stage that in 1167 the Cathari
held a council of their own near Toulouse; a bishop of their order,
Nicetas, coming from Constantinople to preside; and a whole system of
French sees was set on foot.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17084src" href=
"#xd25e17084" name="xd25e17084src">105</a> So numerous had the Cathari
now become that their highest grade, the <i lang="it">perfecti</i>,
alone was reckoned to number 4,000;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17090src" href="#xd25e17090" name="xd25e17090src">106</a> and
from this time it is of Cathari that we read in the rolls of
persecution. About 1170 four more of them, from Flanders, were burned
at Cologne; and others, of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297"
href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>higher grade called <i lang=
"it">bos homes</i> (= <i lang="la">boni homines</i>, &ldquo;good
men&rdquo;), at Toulouse. In 1179, the heresy still gaining ground, an
&oelig;cumenical council (the Third Lateran) was held at Rome under
Pope Alexander III, decreeing afresh their excommunication, and setting
up a new machinery of extirpation by proclaiming a crusade at once
against the orderly heretics of southern France and the companies of
openly irreligious freebooters who had arisen as a result of many wars
and much misgovernment. To all who joined in the crusade was offered an
indulgence of two years. In the following year Henry of Clairvaux,
Cardinal of Albano, took the matter in hand as papal plenipotentiary;
and in 1181 he raised a force of horse and foot and fell upon the
ill-defended territory of the Viscount of Beziers, where many heretics,
including the daughter of Raymond of Toulouse, had taken refuge. The
chief stronghold was captured, with two Catharist bishops, who
renounced their heresy, and were promptly given prebends in Toulouse.
Many others submitted; but as soon as the terms for which the crusaders
had enlisted were over and the army disbanded, they returned to their
heretical practices.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17105src" href=
"#xd25e17105" name="xd25e17105src">107</a> Two years later an army
collected in central France made a campaign against the freebooters,
slaying thousands in one battle, hanging fifteen hundred after another,
and blinding eighty more. But freebooting also continued.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17108src" href="#xd25e17108" name=
"xd25e17108src">108</a></p>
<p>The first crusade against heresy having failed, it was left by the
papacy for a number of years to itself; though anti-pope Lucius III in
1184 sought to set up an Inquisition; and in 1195 a papal legate held a
council at Montpellier, seeking to create another crusade. The zeal of
the faithful was mainly absorbed in Palestine; while the nobles at home
were generally at war with each other. Heresy accordingly continued to
flourish, though there was never any suspension of local persecution
outside of Provence, where the heretics were now in a majority, having
more theological schools and scholars than the Church.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17116src" href="#xd25e17116" name=
"xd25e17116src">109</a> In France in particular, in the early years of
the reign of Philip Augustus (suc. 1180), many <i lang=
"it">paterini</i> were put to death by burning;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17124src" href="#xd25e17124" name="xd25e17124src">110</a> and the
clergy at length persuaded the king to expel the Jews, the work being
done almost as cruelly as it was two centuries later in Spain. In
England, where there was thus far little heresy, it was repressed by
Henry II. Some thirty rustics came from Flanders in 1166, fleeing
persecution, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>and vainly sought to propagate their creed.
Zealous to prove his orthodoxy in the period of his quarrel with
Becket, Henry presided over a council of bishops called by him at
Oxford to discuss the case; and the heretics were condemned to be

winter wilds. &ldquo;England was not hospitable to heresy;&rdquo; and

<p>In southern Europe and northern Italy in the last quarter of the
century a foremost place began to be taken by the sect of the
Waldenses, or Vaudois (otherwise the Poor Men of Lyons),
which&mdash;whether deriving from ancient dissent surviving in the Vaux
or Valleys of Piedmont,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17152src" href=

character from the teaching of the Lyons merchant, Peter Waldus, or an
earlier Peter of Vaux or Valdis<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17161src"
href="#xd25e17161" name="xd25e17161src">113</a>&mdash;conforms
substantially to the general heretical tendencies of that age, in that
it rejected the papal authority, contended for the reading of the Bible
by the laity, condemned tithes, disparaged fasting, stipulated for
poverty on the part of priests and denied their special status, opposed
prayers for the dead, and preached peace and non-resistance. In 1199,
at Metz, they were found in possession of a French translation of the
New Testament, the Psalms, and the book of Job&mdash;a new and
startling invasion of the priestly power in the west. Above all, their
men and women alike went about preaching in the towns, in the houses,
and in the churches, and administered the eucharist without
priests.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17167src" href="#xd25e17167" name=
"xd25e17167src">114</a> Thus Cathari, Paterini, Manicheans, and
non-Manichean Albigenses and Waldenses were on all fours for the
Church, as opponents of its economic claims; and when at length, under

after a long period of incessant change,<a class="noteref" id=

desperate measures began to be contemplated. Organized heresy was seen
to be indestructible save by general extirpation; and on economic
grounds it was not to be tolerated. At Orvieto the heresy stamped out
with blood in 1125 was found alive again in 1150; was again put down in
1163 by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Provence and Languedoc, the scene of the first
great papal crusade against anti-clerical heresy, there were
represented all the then existing forces of popular freethought; and
the motives of the crusade were equally typical of the cause of
authority.</p>
<p>1. In addition to the Paulician and other movements of religious
rationalism above noted, the Languedoc region was a centre of
semi-popular literary culture, which was to no small extent
anti-clerical, and by consequence somewhat anti-religious. The
Latin-speaking jongleurs or minstrels, known as Goliards,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17197src" href="#xd25e17197" name=
"xd25e17197src">119</a> possessing as they did a clerical culture, were
by their way of life committed to a joyous rather than an ascetic
philosophy; and though given to blending the language of devotion with
that of the drinking-table, very much after the fashion of Hafiz, they
were capable of burlesquing the mass, the creed, hymns to the Virgin,
the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, confessions, and parts of the gospels, as well
as of keenly satirizing the endless abuses of the Church.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17222src" href="#xd25e17222" name=
"xd25e17222src">120</a> &ldquo;One is astonished to meet, in the Middle
Ages, in a time always represented as crushed under the yoke of
authority, such incredible audacities on the papacy, the episcopacy,
chivalry, on the most revered dogmas of religion, such as paradise,
hell, etc.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17228src" href=
"#xd25e17228" name="xd25e17228src">121</a> The rhymers escaped simply
because there was no police that could catch them. Denounced by some of
the stricter clergy, they were protected by others. They were, in fact,
the minstrels of the free-living churchmen.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Of this type is Guiot of Provence, a Black Friar, the author of
<i lang="fr">La Bible Guiot</i>, written between 1187 and 1206. He is a
lover of good living, a champion of aristocrats, a foe of popular
movements,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17246src" href="#xd25e17246"
name="xd25e17246src">123</a> and withal a little of a buffoon. But it
is to be counted to him for righteousness that he thought the wealth
devoured by the clergy might be more usefully spent on roads, bridges,
and hospitals.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17264src" href="#xd25e17264"
name="xd25e17264src">124</a> He has also a good word for the old pagans
who lived &ldquo;according to reason&rdquo;; and as to his own time, he
is sharply censorious alike of princes, pope, and prelates. The princes
are rascals who &ldquo;do not believe in God,&rdquo; and depress their
nobility; and the breed of the latter has sadly degenerated. The pope
is to be prayed for; but he is ill counselled by his cardinals, who
conform to the ancient tendency of Rome to everything evil; many of the
archbishops and bishops are no better; and the clergy in general are
eaten up by greed and simony.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17270src"
href="#xd25e17270" name="xd25e17270src">125</a> This is in fact the
common note.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17273src" href="#xd25e17273"
name="xd25e17273src">126</a></p>
<p>A kindred spirit is seen in much of the verse alike of the northern
Trouv&egrave;res and the southern Troubadours. A modern Catholic
historian of medieval literature complains that their compositions
&ldquo;abound with the severest ridicule of such persons and of such
things as, in the temper of the age, were highly estimated and most
generally revered,&rdquo; and notes that in consequence they were
ranked by the devout as &ldquo;lewd and impious
libertines.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17278src" href=
"#xd25e17278" name="xd25e17278src">127</a> In particular they satirized
the practice of excommunication and the use made by the Church of hell
and purgatory as sources of revenue.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17284src" href="#xd25e17284" name="xd25e17284src">128</a> Their
anti-clerical poetry having been as far as possible destroyed by the
Inquisition, its character has to be partly inferred from the remains
of the northern trouv&egrave;res&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Ruteboeuf and Raoul
de Houdan, of whom the former wrote a <i lang="fr">Voya de Paradis</i>,
in which Sloth is a canon and Pride a bishop, both on their way to
heaven; while Raoul has a <i lang="fr">Songe d&rsquo;enfer</i> in which
hell is treated in a spirit of the most audacious burlesque.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17303src" href="#xd25e17303" name=
"xd25e17303src">129</a> In a striking passage of the old tale <i lang=
"fr">Aucassin et Nicolette</i> there is na&iuml;vely revealed the
spontaneous revolt against pietism which underlay all these flings of
irreverence. &ldquo;Into paradise,&rdquo; cries Aucassin, &ldquo;go
none but &hellip; those aged priests, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

cripples, and the maimed, who all day long and all night cough before
the altars, and in the crypts beneath the churches; those &hellip; who
are naked and barefoot and full of sores&#8202;&hellip;. Such as these
enter in paradise, and with them have I nought to do. But in hell will
I go. For to hell go the fair clerks and the fair knights who are slain
in the tourney and the great wars, and the stout archer and the loyal
man. With them will I go. And there go the fair and courteous ladies
[of many loves]; and there pass the gold and the silver, the ermine and
all rich furs, harpers and minstrels, and the happy of the world. With
these will I go&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17314src" href="#xd25e17314" name="xd25e17314src">130</a> It was
such a temper, rather than reasoned unbelief, that inspired the
blasphemous parodies in <i>Reynard the Fox</i> and other popular works
of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The Proven&ccedil;al literature, further, was from the first
influenced by the culture of the Saracens,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17324src" href="#xd25e17324" name="xd25e17324src">131</a> who
held Sicily and Calabria in the ninth and tenth centuries, and had held
part of Languedoc itself for a few years in the eighth. On the passing
of the duchy of Provence to Raymond Berenger, Count of Barcelona, at
the end of the eleventh century, not only were the half-Saracenized
Catalans mixed with the Proven&ccedil;als, but Raymond and his
successors freely introduced the arts and science of the Saracens into
their dominion.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17330src" href="#xd25e17330"
name="xd25e17330src">132</a> In the Norman kingdom of Sicily too the
Saracen influence was great even before the time of Frederick II; and
thence it reached afresh through Italy to Provence,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e17335src" href="#xd25e17335" name="xd25e17335src">133</a>
carrying with it everywhere, by way of poetry, an element of
anti-clerical and even of anti-Christian rationalism.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e17344src" href="#xd25e17344" name="xd25e17344src">134</a>
Though this spirit was not that of the Cathari and Waldenses, yet the
fact that the latter strongly condemned the Crusades<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e17356src" href="#xd25e17356" name="xd25e17356src">135</a> was
a point in common between them and the sympathizers with Saracen
culture. And as the tolerant Saracen schools of Spain or the Christian
schools of the same region, which copied their curriculum,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17372src" href="#xd25e17372" name=
"xd25e17372src">136</a> were in that age resorted to by youth from each
of the countries of western Europe for scientific teaching<a class=

"xd25e17378src">137</a>&mdash;all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>latest medical and
most other scientific knowledge being in their hands&mdash;the
influence of such culture must have been peculiarly strong in
Provence.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17394src" href="#xd25e17394" name=
"xd25e17394src">138</a></p>
<p>The medieval mystery-plays and moralities, already common in
Provence, mixed at times with the normal irreverence of illiterate
faith<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17399src" href="#xd25e17399" name=
"xd25e17399src">139</a> a vein of surprisingly pronounced skeptical
criticism,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17408src" href="#xd25e17408"
name="xd25e17408src">140</a> which at the least was a stimulus to
critical thought among the auditors, even if they were supposed to take
it as merely dramatic. Inasmuch as the drama was hereditarily pagan,
and had been continually denounced and ostracized by Fathers and
Councils,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17411src" href="#xd25e17411" name=
"xd25e17411src">141</a> it would be natural that its practitioners,
even when in the service of the Church, should be unbelievers.</p>
<p>The philosophy and science of both the Arabs and the Spanish Jews
were specially cultivated in the Provence territory. The college of
Montpellier practised on Arab lines medicine, botany, and mathematics;
and the Jews, who had been driven from Spain by the Almohades, had
flourishing schools at Narbonne, Beziers, N&icirc;mes, and Carcassonne,
as well as Montpellier, and spread alike the philosophy of
Averro&euml;s and the semi-rational theology of the Jewish thinker
Maimonides,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17419src" href="#xd25e17419"
name="xd25e17419src">142</a> whose school held broadly by
Averro&iuml;sm.</p>
<p>For the rest, every one of the new literary influences that were
assailing the Church would tend to flourish in such a civilization as
that of Languedoc, which had been peaceful and prosperous for over two
hundred years. Unable to lay hold of the popular poets and minstrels
who propagated anti-clericalism, the papacy could hope to put down by
brute force the social system in which they flourished, crushing the
pious and more hated heretic with the scoffer. And Languedoc was a
peculiarly tempting field for such operations. Its relative lack of
military strength, as well as its pre-eminence in heresy, led Innocent
III, a peculiarly zealous assertor of the papal power,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17446src" href="#xd25e17446" name=
"xd25e17446src">143</a> to attack it in preference to other and remoter
centres of enmity. In the first year of his pontificate, 1198,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>he commenced a new and zealous
Inquisition<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17460src" href="#xd25e17460"
name="xd25e17460src">144</a> in the doomed region; and in the year
1207, when as much persecution had been accomplished as the lax faith
of the nobility and many of the bishops would consent to&mdash;an
appeal to the King of France to interfere being disregarded&mdash;the
scheme of a crusade against the dominions of Raymond Count of Toulouse
was conceived and gradually matured. The alternate weakness and
obstinacy of Raymond, and the fresh provocation given by the murder, in
1208, of the arrogant papal legate, Pierre de Castelnau,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17469src" href="#xd25e17469" name=
"xd25e17469src">145</a> permitted the success of the scheme in such
hands. The crusade was planned exactly on the conditions of those
against the Saracens&mdash;the heretics at home being declared far
worse than they.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17472src" href=
"#xd25e17472" name="xd25e17472src">146</a> The crusaders were freed
from payment of interest on their debts, exempted from the jurisdiction
of all law courts, and absolved from all their sins past or
future.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17479src" href="#xd25e17479" name=
"xd25e17479src">147</a> To earn this reward they were to give only
forty days&rsquo; service<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17494src" href=
"#xd25e17494" name="xd25e17494src">148</a>&mdash;a trifle in comparison
with the hardships of the crusades to Palestine. &ldquo;Never therefore
had the cross been taken up with a more unanimous
consent.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17500src" href="#xd25e17500"
name="xd25e17500src">149</a> Bishops and nobles in Burgundy and France,
the English Simon de Montfort, the Abbot of Citeaux, and the Bernardine
monks throughout Europe, combined in the cause; and recruits came from
Austria and Saxony, from Bremen, even from Slavonia, as well as from
northern France.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17505src" href=
"#xd25e17505" name="xd25e17505src">150</a> The result was such a

Toulouse, who was publicly stripped and scourged, and despite the
efforts of his nephew the Count of Albi to make terms, village after
village was fired, all heretics caught were burned, and on the capture
of the city and castle of Beziers (1209), every man, woman, and child
within the walls was slaughtered, many of them in the churches, whither
they had run for refuge. The legate, Arnold abbot of Citeaux, being
asked at an early stage how the heretics were to be distinguished from
the faithful, gave the never-to-be-forgotten answer, &ldquo;Kill all;
God will know his own.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17514src"
href="#xd25e17514" name="xd25e17514src">152</a> Seven thousand dead

plunder removed, the town was burned to the ground, not one house being
left standing. Warned by the fate of Beziers, the people of
Carcassonne, after defending themselves for many days, secretly
evacuated their town; but the legate contrived to capture a number of
the fugitives, of whom he burned alive four hundred, and hanged
fifty.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17526src" href="#xd25e17526" name=

The Church had succeeded, in the name of religion, in bringing half of
Europe to the attainment of the ideal height of wickedness, in that it
had learned to make evil its good; and the papacy had on the whole come
nearer to destroying the moral sense of all Christendom<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17536src" href="#xd25e17536" name=
"xd25e17536src">156</a> than any conceivable combination of other
causes could ever have done in any age.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">According to a long current fiction, it was the Pope
who first faltered when &ldquo;the whole of Christendom demanded the
renewal of those scenes of massacre&rdquo; (Sismondi, <i>Crusades</i>,
p. 95); but this is disproved by the discovery of two letters in which,
shortly before his death, he excitedly takes on himself the
responsibility for all the bloodshed (Michelet, <i lang="fr">Hist. de
France</i>, vii, introd. note to &sect; iv). Michelet had previously
accepted the legend which he here rejects. The bishops assembled in
council at Lavaur, in 1213, demanded the extermination of the entire
population of Toulouse. Finally, the papal policy is expressly decreed
in the third canon of the Fourth General Council of Lateran, 1215. On
that canon see <i>The Statutes of the Fourth General Council of
Lateran</i>, by the Rev. John Evans, 1843. On the crusade in general,
cp. Lea, <i>History of the Inquisition</i>, bk. i, ch. iv; Gieseler,
Per. III, Div. iii, &sect; 89.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first crusade was followed by others, in which Simon de Montfort
reached the maximum of massacre, varying his procedure by tearing out
eyes and cutting off noses when he was not hanging victims by dozens or
burning them by scores or putting them to the sword by
hundreds<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17560src" href="#xd25e17560" name=

maintained a close rivalry. The Church&rsquo;s great difficulty was
that as soon as an army had bought its plenary indulgence for all
possible sin by forty days&rsquo; service, it disbanded. Nevertheless,
&ldquo;the greater <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305"

where heresy had prevailed was exterminated.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

Provence and Languedoc<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17577src" href=
"#xd25e17577" name="xd25e17577src">161</a> while the fanatics of Islam
in their comparatively bloodless manner were doing as much for that of

could sustain freethinking had been destroyed, and in course of time it
was eliminated by the sleepless engines of the Church.</p>
<p>It was owing to no lack of the principle of evil in the Christian
system, but simply to the much greater and more uncontrollable
diversity of the political elements of Christendom, that the whole
culture and intelligence of Europe did not undergo the same fate. The

<p class="first">It is still common to speak of the <i>personnel</i> of
the Inquisition as disinterested, and to class its crimes as
&ldquo;conscientious.&rdquo; Buckle set up such a thesis, without due
circumspection, as a support to one of his generalizations. (See the
present writer&rsquo;s ed. of his <i>Introduction to the History of
Civilization in England</i>, pp. 105&ndash;108, <i>notes</i>, and the
passages in McCrie and Llorente there cited.) Dr. Lea, whose <i>History
of the Inquisition</i> is the greatest storehouse of learning on the
subject, takes up a similar position, arguing (i, 239): &ldquo;That the
men who conducted the Inquisition, and who toiled sedulously in its
arduous, repulsive, and often dangerous labour, were thoroughly
convinced that they were furthering the kingdom of God, is shown by the
habitual practice of encouraging them with the remission of sins,
similar to that offered for a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land&rdquo;&mdash;a somewhat surprising theorem. Parallel reasoning
would prove that soldiers never plunder and are always Godly; that the
crusaders were all conscientious men; and that policemen never take
bribes or commit perjury. The interpretation of history calls for a
less simple-minded psychology. That there were devoted fanatics in the
Inquisition as in the Church is not to be disputed; that both
organizations had economic bases is certain; and that the majority of
office-bearers in both, in the ages of faith, had regard to gain, is
demonstrated by all ecclesiastical history.</p>
<p>Dr. Lea&rsquo;s own History shows clearly enough (i, 471&ndash;533)
that the Inquisition, from the first generation of its existence, lived
upon its fines and confiscations. &ldquo;Persecution, as a steady and
continuous policy, rested, after all, upon confiscation&#8202;&hellip;.
When it was lacking, the business of defending the faith lagged
lamentably&rdquo; (i, 529). &ldquo;But for the gains to be made out of
fines and confiscations its [the Inquisition&rsquo;s] work would have
been much less thorough, and it would have sunk into comparative
insignificance as soon as the first frantic zeal of bigotry had
exhausted itself&rdquo; (pp. 532&ndash;33). Why, in the face of these
avowals, &ldquo;it would be unjust to say that greed and thirst for
plunder were the impelling motives of the Inquisition&rdquo; (p. 532)
is not very clear. See below, ch. x, &sect; 3, as to the causation in
Spain. Cp. Mocatta, <i>The Jews and the Inquisition</i>, pp. 37, 44,
52. On the Inquisition in Portugal, in turn, Professor W. E. Collins
sums up that &ldquo;it was founded for reasons ostensibly religious but
actually fiscal&rdquo; (in the &ldquo;Cambridge Modern History,&rdquo;
vol. ii, <i>The Reformation</i>, ch. xii, p. 415). Every charge of
economic motive that Catholicism can bring against Protestantism is
thus balanced by the equivalent charge against its own Inquisition.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The indestructibility of freethought, meanwhile, was
being proved even in the philosophic schools, under all their
conformities to faith. Already in the ninth century we have seen Scotus
Erigena putting the faith in jeopardy by his philosophic defence of it.
Another thinker, Roscelin (or Roussellin: fl. 1090), is interesting as
having made a critical approach to freethought in religion by way of
abstract philosophy. With him definitely begins the long academic
debate between the Nominalists and Realists so called. In an undefined
way, it had existed as early as the ninth century,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e17646src" href="#xd25e17646" name="xd25e17646src">169</a> the
ground being the Christian adoption of Plato&rsquo;s doctrine of
ideas&mdash;that individual objects are instances or images of an ideal
universal, which is a real existence, and prior to the individual
thing: &ldquo;<i lang="la">universalia ante rem.</i>&rdquo; To that
proposition Aristotle had opposed the doctrine that the universal is
immanent in the thing&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang="la">universalia in
re</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the latter alone being matter of
knowledge;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17655src" href="#xd25e17655"
name="xd25e17655src">170</a> and in the Middle Ages those who called
Aristotle master carried his negation of Plato to the extent of
insisting that the &ldquo;universal&rdquo; or &ldquo;abstract,&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;form&rdquo; or &ldquo;species,&rdquo; is a mere
subjective creation, a name, having no real existence. This, the
Nominalist position&mdash;mistakenly ascribed to Aristotle<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17658src" href="#xd25e17658" name=
"xd25e17658src">171</a>&mdash;was ultimately expressed in the formula,
&ldquo;<i lang="la">universalia post rem.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such reasonings obviously tend to implicate theology; and Roscelin
was either led or helped by his Nominalist training to deny either
explicitly or implicitly the unity of the Trinity, arguing in effect
that, as only individuals are real existences, the actuality of the
persons of the Trinity involves their disunity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17669src" href="#xd25e17669" name="xd25e17669src">172</a> The
thesis, of course, evoked a storm, the English Archbishop Anselm and
others producing indignant answers. Of Roscelin&rsquo;s writing only
one letter is extant; and even Anselm, in criticizing his alleged
doctrine, admits having gathered it only from his opponents, whose
language suggests perversion.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17674src"
href="#xd25e17674" name="xd25e17674src">173</a> But if the testimony of
his pupil Abailard be truthful,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17677src"
href="#xd25e17677" name="xd25e17677src">174</a> he was at best a
confused reasoner; and in his theology he got no further than
tritheism, then called ditheism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17680src"
href="#xd25e17680" name="xd25e17680src">175</a> Thus, though
&ldquo;Nominalism, by denying any objective reality to general notions,
led the way directly to the testimony of the senses and the conclusions
of experience,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17689src" href=
"#xd25e17689" name="xd25e17689src">176</a> it did so on lines fatally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>subordinate to the theology it sought to
correct. Roscelin&rsquo;s thesis logically led to the denial not only
of trinity-in-unity but of the Incarnation and transubstantiation; yet
neither he nor his opponents seem to have thought even of the last
consequence, he having in fact no consciously heretical intention.
Commanded to recant by the Council of Soissons in 1092, he did so, and
resumed his teaching as before; whereafter he was ordered to leave
France. Coming to England, he showed himself so little of a rebel to
the papacy as to contend strongly for priestly celibacy, arguing that
all sons of priests and all born out of wedlock should alike be
excluded from clerical office. Expelled from England in turn for these
views, by a clergy still anti-celibate, he returned to Paris, to revive
the old philosophic issue, until general hostility drove him to
Aquitaine, where he spent his closing years in peace.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e17698src" href="#xd25e17698" name="xd25e17698src">177</a></p>
<p>Such handling of the cause of Nominalism gave an obvious advantage
to Realism. That has been justly described by one clerical scholar as
&ldquo;Philosophy held in subordination to
Church-Authority&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17703src" href=
"#xd25e17703" name="xd25e17703src">178</a> and another has avowed that
&ldquo;the spirit of Realism was essentially the spirit of dogmatism,
the disposition to pronounce that truth was already known,&rdquo; while
&ldquo;Nominalism was essentially the spirit of progress, of inquiry,
of criticism.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17706src" href=
"#xd25e17706" name="xd25e17706src">179</a> But even a critical
philosophy may be made to capitulate to authority, as even &agrave;
priori metaphysic may be to a certain extent turned against it. Realism
had been markedly heretical in the hands of John Scotus; and in a later
age the Realist John Huss was condemned to death&mdash;perhaps on
political grounds, but not without signs of sectarian hate&mdash;by a
majority of Nominalists at the Council of Constance. Everything
depended on the force of the individual thinker and the degree of
restraint put upon him by the authoritarian environment.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17724src" href="#xd25e17724" name=
"xd25e17724src">180</a> The world has even seen the spectacle of a
professed indifferentist justifying the massacre of St. Bartholomew;
and the Platonist Marsilio Ficino vilified Savonarola, basely enough,
after his execution, adjusting a pantheistic Christianity to the needs
of the political situation in Medicean Florence. Valid freethinking is
a matter of thoroughness and rectitude, not of mere theoretic
assents.</p>
<p>Tried by that test, the Nominalism of the medieval schools was no
very potent emancipator of the human spirit, no very clear herald
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>of freedom or new concrete truth. A doctrine
which was so far adjusted to authority as to affirm the unquestionable
existence of three deities, Father, Son, and Spirit, and merely
disputed the not more supra-rational theorem of their unity, yielded to
the rival philosophy a superiority in the kind of credit it sought for
itself. Nominalism was thus &ldquo;driven to the shade of the
schools,&rdquo; where it was &ldquo;regarded entirely in a logical
point of view, and by no means in its actual philosophic importance as
a speculation concerning the grounds of human
knowledge.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17737src" href=
"#xd25e17737" name="xd25e17737src">181</a> For Roscelin himself the
question was one of dialectics, not of faith, and he made no practical
rationalists. The popular heresies bit rather deeper into
life.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17740src" href="#xd25e17740" name=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">It is doubtless true of the Paulicians that
&ldquo;there was no principle of development in their creed: it
reflected no genuine freedom of thought&rdquo; (Poole,
<i>Illustrations</i>, p. 95); but the same thing, as we have seen, is
clearly true of scholasticism itself. It may indeed be urged that
&ldquo;the contest between Ratramn and Paschase on the doctrine of the
Eucharist; of Lanfranc with Berengar on the same subject; of Anselm
with Roscelin on the nature of Universals; the complaints of Bernard
against the dialectical theology of Abelard; are all illustrations of
the collision between Reason and Authority &hellip; varied forms of
rationalism&mdash;the pure exertions of the mind within itself &hellip;
against the constringent force of the Spiritual government&rdquo;
(Hampden, Bampton Lectures on <i>The Scholastic Philosophy</i>, 3rd ed.
p. 37; cp. Hardwick, <i>Church History: Middle Age</i>, p. 203); but
none of the scholastics ever professed to set Authority aside. None
dared. John Scotus indeed affirmed the identity of true religion with
true philosophy, without professing to subordinate the latter; but the
most eminent of the later scholastics affirmed such a subordination.
&ldquo;The vassalage of philosophy consisted in the fact that an
impassable limit was fixed for the freedom of philosophizing in the
dogmas of the Church&rdquo; (Ueberweg, i, 357); and some of the chief
dogmas were not allowed to be philosophically discussed; though,
&ldquo;with its territory thus limited, philosophy was indeed allowed
by theology a freedom which was rarely and only by exception infringed
upon&rdquo; (<i>ib.</i> Cp. Milman, <i>Latin Christianity</i>, 4th ed.
ix, 151). &ldquo;The suspicion of originality was fatal to the
reputation of the scholastic divine&rdquo; (Hampden, pp. 46&ndash;47).
The popular heresy, indeed, lacked the intellectual stimulus that came
to the schools from the philosophy of Averro&euml;s; but it was the
hardier movement of the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Already in the eleventh century, however, the simple fact of the
production of a new argument for the existence of God by Anselm,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>Archbishop of Canterbury, is a proof that, apart
from the published disputes, a measure of doubt on the fundamental
issue had arisen in the schools. It is urged<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17769src" href="#xd25e17769" name="xd25e17769src">183</a> that,
though the argumentation of Anselm seems alien to the thought of his
time, there is no proof that the idea of proving the existence of God
was in any way pressed on him from the outside. It is, however,
inconceivable that such an argument should be framed if no one had
raised a doubt. And as a matter of fact the question <i>was</i>
discussed in the schools, Anselm&rsquo;s treatise being a reproduction
of his teaching. The monks of Bec, where he taught, urged him to write
a treatise wherein nothing should be proved by mere authority, but all
by necessity of reason or evidence of truth, and with an eye to
objections of all sorts.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17778src" href=
"#xd25e17778" name="xd25e17778src">184</a> In the preface to his
<i lang="la">Cur Deus Homo</i>, again, he says that his first book is
an answer to the objections of infidels who reject Christianity as
irrational.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17786src" href="#xd25e17786"
name="xd25e17786src">185</a> Further, the nature of part of
Anselm&rsquo;s theistic argument and the very able but friendly reply
of Gaunilo (a Count of Montigni, who entered a convent near Tours,
1044&ndash;1083) show that the subject was within the range of private
discussion. Anselm substantially follows St. Augustine;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17795src" href="#xd25e17795" name=
"xd25e17795src">186</a> and men cannot have read the ancient books
which so often spoke of atheism without confronting the atheistic idea.
It is not to be supposed that Gaunilo was an unbeliever; but his
argumentation is that of a man who had pondered the problem.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e17798src" href="#xd25e17798" name=
"xd25e17798src">187</a></p>
<p>Despite the ostensibly rationalistic nature of his argument,
however, Anselm stipulated for absolute submission of the intellect to
the creed of the Church;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17814src" href=
"#xd25e17814" name="xd25e17814src">188</a> so that the original
subtitle of his Proslogium, <i lang="la">Fides quaerens
intellectum</i>, in no way admits rational tests. In the next century
we meet with new evidence of sporadic unbelief, and new attempts to
deal with it on the philosophic side. John of Salisbury
(1120&ndash;1180) tells of having heard many discourse on physics
&ldquo;otherwise than faith may hold&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17820src" href="#xd25e17820" name="xd25e17820src">189</a> and the
same vivacious scholar put in his list of &ldquo;things about which a
wise man may doubt, so &hellip; that the doubt extend not to the
multitude,&rdquo; some &ldquo;things which are reverently to be
inquired about God himself.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17823src"
href="#xd25e17823" name="xd25e17823src">190</a> Giraldus Cambrensis
(1147&ndash;1223), whose abundant and credulous gossip throws so much
light on the inner life of the Church and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>laity in his age, tells that the learned Simon
of Tournay &ldquo;thought not soundly on the articles of the
faith,&rdquo; saying privately, to his intimates, things that he dared
not utter publicly, till one day, in a passion, he cried out,
&ldquo;Almighty God! how long shall this superstitious sect of
Christians and this upstart invention endure?&rdquo;; whereupon during
the night he lost the power of speech, and remained helpless till his
death.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17831src" href="#xd25e17831" name=
"xd25e17831src">191</a> Other ecclesiastical chroniclers represent
Simon as deriding alike Jesus, Moses, and Mahomet&mdash;an ascription
to him of the &ldquo;three impostors&rdquo; formula.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e17836src" href="#xd25e17836" name="xd25e17836src">192</a>
Again, Giraldus tells how an unnamed priest, reproved by another for
careless celebration of the mass, angrily asked whether his rebuker
really believed in transubstantiation, in the incarnation, in the
Virgin Birth, and in resurrection; adding that it was all carried on by
hypocrites, and assuredly invented by cunning ancients to hold men in
terror and restraint. And Giraldus comments that <i lang="la">inter
nos</i> there are many who so think in secret.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17845src" href="#xd25e17845" name="xd25e17845src">193</a> As his
own picture of the Church exhibits a gross and almost universal
rapacity pervading it from the highest clergy to the lowest, the
statement is entirely credible.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17850src"
href="#xd25e17850" name="xd25e17850src">194</a> Yet again, in the
Romance of the Holy Grail, mention is twice made of clerical doubters
on the doctrine of the Trinity;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17856src"
href="#xd25e17856" name="xd25e17856src">195</a> and on that side, in
the crusading period, both the monotheistic doctrine of Islam and the
Arab philosophy of Averro&euml;s were likely to set up a certain amount
of skepticism. In the twelfth century, accordingly, we have Nicolas of
Amiens producing his tractate <i lang="la">De articulis</i> (or
<i lang="la">arte</i>) <i lang="la">catholic&aelig; fidei</i> in the
hope of convincing by his arguments men &ldquo;who disdain to believe
the prophecies and the gospel.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>To meet such skepticism too was one of the undertakings of the
renowned <span class="sc">Abailard</span> (1079&ndash;1142), himself
persecuted as a heretic for the arguments with which he sought to guard
against unbelief. Of the details of his early life it concerns us here
to note only that he studied under Roscelin, and swerved somewhat in
philosophy from his master&rsquo;s theoretic Nominalism, which he
partly modified on Aristotelian lines, though knowing little of
Aristotle.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17885src" href="#xd25e17885"
name="xd25e17885src">197</a> After his retirement from the world to the
cloister, he was induced to resume philosophic teaching; and his
pupils, like those of Anselm, begged their master to give them rational
arguments on the main points of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312"

id="xd25e17890src" href="#xd25e17890" name="xd25e17890src">198</a> He
accordingly rashly prepared a treatise, <i lang="la">De Unitate et

"xd25e17903src">199</a> Thereupon envious rivals, of whom he had made
many by his arrogance as well as by his fame, set up against him a
heresy hunt; and for the rest of his life he figured as a dangerous
person. While, however, he took up the relatively advanced position
that reason must prepare the way for faith, since otherwise faith has
no certitude,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17907src" href="#xd25e17907"
name="xd25e17907src">200</a> he was in the main dependent on the
authority either of second-hand Aristotle<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e17910src" href="#xd25e17910" name="xd25e17910src">201</a> or of
the Scriptures, though he partly set aside that of the
Fathers.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17916src" href="#xd25e17916" name=
"xd25e17916src">202</a> When St. Bernard accused him of Arianism and of
heathenism he was expressing personal ill-will rather than criticizing.
Abailard himself complained that many heresies were current in his
time<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17919src" href="#xd25e17919" name=
"xd25e17919src">203</a>; and as a matter of fact &ldquo;more intrepid

conspicuous masters.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17922src" href=
"#xd25e17922" name="xd25e17922src">204</a> For instance, Bernard
Sylvester (of Chartres), in his cosmology, treated theological

rejected the literal interpretation of the creation of Eve; in science
he adopted the Demokritean doctrine of atoms; and in New Testament
matters he revived the old rationalistic heresy that the three Persons
of the Trinity are simply three aspects of the divine
personality&mdash;power, wisdom, and will&mdash;which doctrine he was
duly forced to retract. It is clear from his works that he lived in an
atmosphere of controversy, and had to fight all along with the pious
irrationalists who, &ldquo;because they know not the forces of nature,
in order that they may have all men comrades in their ignorance, suffer
not that others should search out anything, and would have us believe
like rustics and ask no reason.&rdquo; &ldquo;If they perceive any man
to be making search, they at once cry out that he is a heretic.&rdquo;

<blockquote>
<p class="first">As to William&rsquo;s doctrines and writings see
Poole, pp. 124&ndash;30, 346&ndash;59. His authorship of one treatise
is only latterly cleared up. In the work which under the title of
<i lang="la">Elementa Philosophiae</i> is falsely ascribed to Bede, and
under the title <i lang="la">De Philosophia Mundi</i> to Honorius of
Autun (see Poole, pp. 340&ndash;42, 347 sq.), but which is really the
production of William of Conches, there occurs the passage: &ldquo;What
is more pitiable than to say that a thing <i>is</i>, because God is
able to do it, and not to show any reason why it is so; just as if God
did everything that he is able to do! You talk like one who says that
God is able to make a calf out of a log. But <i>did</i> he ever do it?
Either, then, show a reason why a thing is so, or a purpose wherefore
it is so, or else cease to declare it so.&rdquo; Migne, <i>Patrolog.
Latin.</i> xc, 1139. It is thus an exaggeration to say of Abailard, as
does Cousin, that &ldquo;<span lang="fr">il mit de c&ocirc;t&eacute; la
vieille &eacute;cole d&rsquo;Anselme de Laon, qui exposait sans
expliquer, et fonda ce qu&rsquo;on appelle aujourd&rsquo;hui le
rationalisme</span>&rdquo; (<i lang="fr">Ouvr. in&eacute;dits
d&rsquo;Ab&eacute;lard</i>, 1836, intr. p. ii).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abailard was not more explicit on concrete issues than this
contemporary&mdash;who survived him, and studied his writings. If,
indeed, as is said, he wrote that &ldquo;a doctrine is believed not
because God has said it, but because we are convinced by reason that it
is so,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17970src" href="#xd25e17970"
name="xd25e17970src">208</a> he went as far on one line as any
theologian of his time; but his main service to freethought seems to
have lain in the great stimulus he gave to the practice of reasoning on
all topics.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e17976src" href="#xd25e17976"
name="xd25e17976src">209</a> His enemy, St. Bernard, on the contrary,
gave an &ldquo;immense impulse to the growth of a genuinely

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Dr. Rashdall pronounces Abailard &ldquo;incomparably
the greatest intellect of the Middle Ages; one of the great minds which
mark a period in the world&rsquo;s intellectual history&rdquo;; and
adds that &ldquo;Abailard (a Christian thinker to the very
heart&rsquo;s core, however irredeemable (<i>sic</i>) the selfishness
and overweening vanity of his youth) was at the same time the
representative of the principle of free though reverent inquiry in
matters of religion and individual loyalty to truth.&rdquo; (<i>The
Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages</i>, 1895, i, 56&ndash;57.)
If the praise given be intended to exalt Abailard above John Scotus, it
seems excessive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a survey of Abailard&rsquo;s theological teachings, a modern
reader <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>is apt to see the spirit of moral reason most
clearly in one set forth in his commentary on the Epistle to the
Romans, to the effect that Jesus was not incarnate to redeem men from
damnation, but solely to instruct them by precept and example, and that
he suffered and died only to show his charity towards men. The thesis
was implicit if not explicit in the teaching of Pelagius; and for both
men it meant the effort to purify their creed from the barbaric taint
of the principle of sacrifice. In our own day, revived by such
theologians as the English Maurice, it seems likely to gain ground, as
an accommodation to the embarrassed moral sense of educated believers.
But it is heresy if heresy ever was, besides being a blow at the heart
of Catholic sacerdotalism; and Abailard on condemnation retracted it as
he did his other Pelagian errors. Retractation, however, is
publication; and to have been sentenced to retract such teaching in the
twelfth century is to leave on posterity an impression of moral
originality perhaps as important as the fame of a metaphysician. In any
case, it is a careful judge who thus finally estimates him: &ldquo;When
he is often designated as the rationalist among the schoolmen, he
deserves the title not only on account of the doctrine of the Trinity,
which approaches Sabellianism in spite of all his polemics against it,
and not only on account of his critical attempts, but also on account
of his ethics, in which he actually completely agrees in the principal
point with many modern rationalists.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

is latterly his singular fate to be valued at once by many sympathetic
Catholics, who hold him finally vindicated alike in life and doctrine,

<p>How far the stir set up in Europe by his personal magnetism and his
personal record may have made for rational culture, it is impossible to
estimate; but some consequence there must have been. John of Salisbury
was one of Abailard&rsquo;s disciples and admirers; and, as we saw, he
not only noted skepticism in others but indicated an infusion of it in
his own mind&mdash;enough to earn for him from a modern historian the
praise of being a sincere skeptic, as against those false skeptics who
put forward universal doubt as a stalking horse for their
mysticism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18025src" href="#xd25e18025"
name="xd25e18025src">212</a> But he was certainly not a universal
skeptic<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18031src" href="#xd25e18031" name=

goodness and power of God<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18039src" href=
"#xd25e18039" name="xd25e18039src">214</a> sounds orthodox enough. What
he gained from Abailard was a concern for earnest dialectic.</p>
<p>The worst side of scholasticism at all times was that it was more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>often than not a mere logical expatiation
<i lang="la">in vacuo</i>; this partly for sheer lack of real
knowledge. John of Salisbury probably did not do injustice to the habit
of verbiage it developed<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18052src" href=
"#xd25e18052" name="xd25e18052src">215</a>; and the pupils of Abailard
seem to have expressed themselves strongly to him concerning the wordy
emptiness of most of what passed current as philosophic discourse;
speaking of the teachers as blind leaders of the blind.<a class=

"xd25e18058src">216</a> One version of the legend against Simon of
Tournay is to the effect that, after demonstrating by the most skilful
arguments the truth of the doctrine of the Trinity, he went on to say,
when enraptured listeners besought him to dictate his address so that
it might be preserved, that if he had been evilly minded he could
refute the doctrine by yet better arguments.<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Even in the schools, however, over and above the
influence of the more original teachers, there rises at the close of
the twelfth century and the beginning of the thirteenth some measure of
a new life, introduced into philosophy through the communication of
Aristotle to the western world by the Saracens, largely by the
mediation of the Jews.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18085src" href=
"#xd25e18085" name="xd25e18085src">218</a> The latter, in their free
life under the earlier Moorish toleration, had developed something in
the nature of a school of philosophy, in which the Judaic Platonism set
up by Philo of Alexandria in the first century was blended with the
Aristotelianism of the Arabs. As early as the eighth and ninth
centuries, anti-Talmudic (the Kara&iuml;tes) and pro-Talmudic parties
professed alike to appeal to reason<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e18096src" href="#xd25e18096" name="xd25e18096src">219</a>; and in
the twelfth century the mere production of the <i>Guide of the
Perplexed</i> by the celebrated Moses Maimonides
(1130&ndash;1205)<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18105src" href=
"#xd25e18105" name="xd25e18105src">220</a> tells of a good deal of
practical rationalism (of the kind that reduced miracle stories to
allegories), of which, however, there is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

literary result save of a theosophic kind.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e18111src" href="#xd25e18111" name="xd25e18111src">221</a> Levi
ben Gershom (1286&ndash;1344), commonly regarded as the greatest
successor of Maimonides, is like him guardedly rationalistic in his
commentaries on the Scriptures.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18126src"
href="#xd25e18126" name="xd25e18126src">222</a> But the doctrine which
makes Aristotle a practical support to rationalism, and which was
adopted not only by Averro&euml;s but by the Motazilites of
Islam&mdash;the eternity of matter&mdash;was rejected by Maimonides (as
by nearly all other Jewish teachers, with the partial exception of Levi
ben Gershom),<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18132src" href="#xd25e18132"
name="xd25e18132src">223</a> on Biblical grounds; though his attempts
to rationalize Biblical doctrine and minimize miracles made him odious
to the orthodox Jews, some of whom, in France, did not scruple to call
in the aid of the Christian inquisition against his partisans.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18137src" href="#xd25e18137" name=
"xd25e18137src">224</a> The long struggle between the Maimonists and
the orthodox is described as ending in the &ldquo;triumph of
peripatetism&rdquo; or Averro&iuml;sm in the synagogue<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18140src" href="#xd25e18140" name=
"xd25e18140src">225</a>; but Averro&iuml;sm as modified by Maimonides
is only a partial accommodation of scripture to common sense. It would
appear, in fact, that Jewish thought in the Saracen world retrograded
as did that of the Saracens themselves; for we find Maimonides
exclaiming over the apparent disbelief in <i lang="la">creatio ex
nihilo</i> in the &ldquo;Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer the Great,&rdquo;
believed by him to be ancient, but now known to be a product of the
eighth century.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18150src" href="#xd25e18150"

in point of time preceded the Arab Avempace, and who later acquired
much Christian authority, was orthodox on the side of the creation
dogma even when many Jews were on that head rationalistic.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18159src" href="#xd25e18159" name=
"xd25e18159src">228</a> The high-water mark, among the Jews, of the
critical rationalism of the time, is the perception by Aben or Ibn Ezra
(1119&ndash;1174) that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses&mdash;a
discovery which gave Spinoza his cue five hundred years later; but Ibn
Ezra, <i lang="la">liberioris ingenii vir</i>, as Spinoza pronounced
him, had to express himself darkly.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Thus the Jewish influence on Christian thought in the Middle Ages
was chiefly metaphysical, carrying on Greek and Arab impulses; and to
call the Jewish people, as does Renan, &ldquo;the principal
representative of rationalism during the second half of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>the
Middle Age&rdquo; is to make too much of the academic aspects of
freethinking. On the side of popular theology it is difficult to
believe that they had much Unitarian influence; though Joinville in his
Life of Saint Louis tells how, in a debate between Churchmen and Jews
at the monastery of Cluny, a certain knight saw fit to break the head
of one of the Jews with his staff for denying the divinity of Jesus,
giving as his reason that many good Christians, listening to the Jewish
arguments, were in a fair way to go home unbelievers. It was in this
case that the sainted king laid down the principle that when a layman
heard anyone blaspheme the Christian creed his proper course was not to
argue, but to run the blasphemer through with his sword.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18180src" href="#xd25e18180" name=
"xd25e18180src">230</a> Such admitted inability on the part of the
laity to reason on their faith, however, was more likely to accompany a
double degree of orthodoxy than to make for doubt; and the clerical
debating at the Abbey of Cluny, despite the honourable attitude of the
Abbot, who condemned the knight&rsquo;s outrage, was probably a muster
of foregone conclusions.</p>
<p>For a time, indeed, in the energetic intellectual life of northern
France the spirit of freethought went far and deep. After the great
stimulus given in Abailard&rsquo;s day to all discussion, we find
another Breton teacher, <span class="sc">Amaury</span> or Amalrich of
B&egrave;ne or Bena (end of twelfth century) and his pupil David of
Dinant, partly under the earlier Arab influence,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e18190src" href="#xd25e18190" name="xd25e18190src">231</a> partly
under that of John the Scot,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18196src" href=
"#xd25e18196" name="xd25e18196src">232</a> teaching a pronounced
pantheism, akin to that noted as flourishing later among the Brethren
of the Free Spirit<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18208src" href=
"#xd25e18208" name="xd25e18208src">233</a> and some of the Franciscan
Fraticelli. Such a movement, involving disregard for the sacraments and
ceremonies of the Church, was soon recognized as a dangerous heresy,
and dealt with accordingly. The Church caused Amaury to abjure his
teachings; and after his death, finding his party still growing, dug up
and burned his bones. At the same time (1209) a number of his followers
were burned alive; David of Dinant had to fly for his life;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18217src" href="#xd25e18217" name=
"xd25e18217src">234</a> and inasmuch as the new heresy had begun to
make much of Aristotle, presumably as interpreted by Averro&euml;s, a
Council held at Paris vetoed for the university the study alike of the
pagan master and his commentators, interdicting first the
<i>Physics</i> and soon after the <i>Metaphysics</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e18227src" href="#xd25e18227" name="xd25e18227src">235</a> This
veto held until 1237, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href=
"#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>the school which adapted the lore
of Aristotle to Christian purposes began to carry the day.</p>
<p>The heretical Aristotelianism and the orthodox system which was to
overpower it were alike radiated from the south, where the Arab
influence spread early and widely. There, as we shall see, the long
duel between the Emperor Frederick II and the papacy made a special
opportunity for speculative freethought; and though this was far from
meaning at all times practical enmity to Christian doctrine,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18234src" href="#xd25e18234" name=
"xd25e18234src">236</a> that was not absent. It is clear that before
Thomas Aquinas (1225&ndash;1274) a Naturalist and Averro&iuml;st view
of the universe had been much discussed, since he makes the remark that
&ldquo;God is by some called <i lang="la">Natura
naturans</i>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18243src" href=
"#xd25e18243" name="xd25e18243src">237</a>&mdash;Nature at
work&mdash;an idea fundamental alike to pantheism and to scientific
naturalism. And throughout his great work&mdash;a marvel of mental
gymnastic which better than almost any other writing redeems medieval
orthodoxy from the charge of mere ineptitude&mdash;Thomas indicates his
acquaintance with unorthodox thought. In particular he seems to owe the
form of his work as well as the subject-matter of much of his argument
to Averro&euml;s.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18254src" href=
"#xd25e18254" name="xd25e18254src">238</a> Born within the sphere of
the Saracen-Sicilian influence, and of high rank, he must have met with
what rationalism there was, and he always presupposes it.<a class=

others who were trained in the study of them&#8202;&hellip;. He has
done more than most men to put the faith of his fellow-Christians in
peril.&rdquo; Of course he rejects Averro&iuml;sm. Yet he, like his
antagonist Duns Scotus, inevitably gravitates to pantheism when he
would rigorously philosophize.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18285src"

<p>What he did for his church was to combine so ingeniously the
semblance of Aristotelian method with constant recurrence to the sacred
books as to impose their authority on the life of the schools
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>no less completely than it dominated the minds
of the unlearned. Meeting method with method, and showing himself well
aware of the lore he circumvented, he built up a system quite as well
fitted to be a mere gymnastic of the mind; and he thereby effected the
arrest for some three centuries of the method of experimental science
which Aristotle had inculcated. He came just in time. Roger Bacon,
trained at Paris, was eagerly preaching the scientific gospel; and
while he was suffering imprisonment at the hands of his Franciscan
superiors for his eminently secular devotion to science, the freer
scholars of the university were developing a heresy that outwent
his.</p>
<p>Now, however, began to be seen once for all the impossibility of
rational freedom in or under a church which depended for its revenue on
the dogmatic exploitation of popular credulity. For a time the
Aristotelian influence, as had been seen by the churchmen who had first
sought to destroy it,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18294src" href=
"#xd25e18294" name="xd25e18294src">243</a> tended to be Averro&iuml;st
and rationalist.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18300src" href=
"#xd25e18300" name="xd25e18300src">244</a> In 1269, however, there
begins a determined campaign, led by the bishop of Paris, against the
current Averro&iuml;st doctrines, notably the propositions &ldquo;that
the world is eternal&rdquo;; &ldquo;that there never was a first
man&rdquo;; &ldquo;that the intellect of man is one&rdquo;; &ldquo;that
the mind, which is the form of man, constituting him such, perishes
with the body&rdquo;; &ldquo;that the acts of men are not governed by
divine providence&rdquo;; &ldquo;that God cannot give immortality or
incorruptibility to a corruptible or mortal thing.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18306src" href="#xd25e18306" name=
"xd25e18306src">245</a> On such doctrines the bishop and his coadjutors
naturally passed an anathema (1270); and at this period it was that
Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas wrote their treatises against
Averro&iuml;sm.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18309src" href="#xd25e18309"
name="xd25e18309src">246</a></p>
<p>Still the freethinkers held out, and though in 1271 official
commands were given that the discussion of such matters in the
university should cease, another process of condemnation was carried
out in 1277. This time the list of propositions denounced includes the
following: &ldquo;that the natural philosopher as such must deny the
creation of the world, because he proceeds upon natural causes and
reasons; while the believer (<i lang="la">fidelis</i>) may deny the
eternity of the world, because he argues from supernatural
causes&rdquo;; &ldquo;that creation is not possible, although the
contrary is to be held according to faith&rdquo;; &ldquo;that a future
resurrection is not to be believed by the philosopher, because it
cannot be investigated by reason&rdquo;; <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e18319" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>that the teachings of
the theologians are founded on fables&rdquo;; &ldquo;that there
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span>are fables and falsities in the Christian
religion as in others&rdquo;; &ldquo;that nothing more can be known, on
account of theology&rdquo;; &ldquo;that the Christian law prevents from
learning&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18324src" href=
"#xd25e18324" name="xd25e18324src">247</a> &ldquo;that God is not
triune and one, for trinity is incompatible with perfect
simplicity&rdquo;; &ldquo;that ecstatic states and visions take place
naturally, and only so.&rdquo; Such vital unbelief could have only one
fate; it was reduced to silence by a papal Bull,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e18330src" href="#xd25e18330" name="xd25e18330src">248</a>
administered by the orthodox majority; and the memory of the massacres
of the year 1209, and of the awful crusade against the Albigenses,
served to cow the thinkers of the schools into an outward
conformity.</p>
<p>Henceforward orthodox Aristotelianism, placed on a canonical footing
in the theological system of Thomas Aquinas, ruled the universities;
and scholasticism counts for little in the liberation of European life
from either dogma or superstition.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18335src"
href="#xd25e18335" name="xd25e18335src">249</a> The practically
progressive forces are to be looked for outside. In the thirteenth
century in England we find the Franciscan friars in the school of
Robert Grosst&ecirc;te at Oxford discussing the question &ldquo;Whether
there be a God?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18341src" href=
"#xd25e18341" name="xd25e18341src">250</a> but such a dispute was an
academic exercise like another; and in any case the authorities could
be trusted to see that it came to nothing. The work of Thomas himself
serves to show how a really great power of comprehensive and orderly
thought can be turned to the subversion of judgment by accepting the
prior dominion of a fixed body of dogma and an arbitrary rule over
opinion. And yet, so strong is the principle of ratiocination in his
large performance, and so much does it embody of the critical forces of
antiquity and of its own day, that while it served the Church as a code
of orthodoxy its influence can be seen in the skeptical philosophy of
Europe as late as Spinoza and Kant. It appears to have been as a result
of his argumentation that there became established in the later
procedure of the Church the doctrine that, while heretics who have once
received the faith and lapsed are to be coerced and punished, other
unbelievers (as Moslems and Jews) are not. This principle also, it
would appear, he derived from the Moslems, as he did their rule that
those of the true faith must avoid intimacy with the unbelievers,
though believers firm in the faith may dispute with them &ldquo;when
there is greater expectation of the conversion of the infidels than of
the subversion of the fidels.&rdquo; And to the rule of non-inquisition
into the faith of Jews and Moslems <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321"
href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>the Church professed to
adhere while the Inquisition lasted, after having trampled it under
foot in spirit by causing the expulsion of the Jews and the Moriscoes
from Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18349src" href="#xd25e18349"
name="xd25e18349src">251</a></p>
<p>We shall perhaps best understand the inner life of the schools in
the Middle Ages by likening it to that of the universities of our own
time, where there is unquestionably much unbelief among teachers and
taught, but where the economic and other pressures of the institution
suffice to preserve an outward acquiescence. In the Middle Ages it was
immeasurably less possible than in our day for the unbeliever to strike
out a free course of life and doctrine for himself. If, then, to-day
the scholarly class is in large measure tied to institutions and
conformities, much more so was it then. The cloister was almost the
sole haven of refuge for studious spirits, and to attain the haven they
had to accept the discipline and the profession of faith. We may
conclude, accordingly, that such works as Abailard&rsquo;s <i lang=
"la">Sic et Non</i>, setting forth opposed views of so many doctrines
and problems, stood for and made for a great deal of quiet
skepticism;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18369src" href="#xd25e18369"
name="xd25e18369src">252</a> that the remarkable request of the monks
of Bec for a ratiocinative teaching which should meet even extravagant
objections, covered a good deal of resigned unfaith; and that in the
Franciscan schools at Oxford the disputants were not all at heart
believers. Indeed, the very existence of the doctrine of a
&ldquo;twofold truth&rdquo;&mdash;one truth for religion and another
for philosophy&mdash;was from the outset a witness for unbelief. But
the unwritten word died, the <i lang="la">litera scripta</i> being
solely those of faith, and liberation had to come, ages later, from
without. Even when a bold saying won general currency&mdash;as that
latterly ascribed, no doubt falsely, to King Alfonso the Wise of
Castile, that &ldquo;if he had been of God&rsquo;s council when he made
the world he could have advised him better&rdquo;&mdash;it did but
crystallize skepticism in a jest, and supply the enemy with a text
against impiety.</p>
<p>All the while, the Church was forging new and more murderous weapons
against reason. It is one of her infamies to have revived the use in
Christendom of the ancient practice of judicial torture, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>and
this expressly for the suppression of heresy. The later European
practice dates from the Bull of Innocent IV, <i lang="la">Ad
extirpanda</i>, dated 1252. At first a veto was put on its
administration by clerical hands; but in 1256 Alexander IV authorized
the inquisitors and their associates to absolve one another for such
acts. By the beginning of the fourteenth century torture was in use not
only in the tribunals of the Inquisition but in the ordinary
ecclesiastical courts, whence it gradually entered into the courts of
lay justice.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18397src" href="#xd25e18397"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Apart from the schools, there was a notable amount of
hardy freethinking among the imperialist nobles of northern Italy, in
the time of the emperors Henry IV and V, the attitude of enmity to the
Holy See having the effect of encouraging a rude rationalism. In 1115,
while Henry V was vigorously carrying on the war of investitures begun
by his father, and formerly condemned by himself, the Countess Matilda
of Tuscany bequeathed her extensive fiefs to the papacy; and in the
following year Henry took forcible possession of them. At this period
the strife between the papal and the imperial factions in the Tuscan
cities was at its fiercest; and the Florentine chronicler Giovanni
Villani alleges that among many other heretics in 1115 and 1117 were
some &ldquo;of the sect of the Epicureans,&rdquo; who &ldquo;with armed
hand defended the said heresy&rdquo; against the orthodox.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18422src" href="#xd25e18422" name=
"xd25e18422src">255</a> But it is doubtful whether the heresy involved
was anything more than imperialist anti-papalism. Another chronicler
speaks of the heretics as <i lang="it">Paterini</i>; and even this is
dubious. The title of Epicurean in the time of Villani and Dante stood
for an unbeliever in a future state;<a class="noteref" id=

there was an avowed tendency to call all Ghibellines <i lang=

applied in the same way.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18436src" href=

assigned either to a spontaneous growth of unbelief or to the obscure
influence of the great poem of Lucretius, never wholly lost from
Italian hands. But the Lucretian view of things among men of the world
naturally remained a matter of private discussion, not of propaganda;
and it was on the less rationalistic but more organized
anti-clericalism that there came the doom of martyrdom. So with the
simple deism of which we find traces in the polemic of Guibert de
Nogent (d. 1124), who avowedly wrote his tract <i lang="la">De
Incarnatione adversus Jud&aelig;os</i> rather as an apology against
unbelievers among the Christians;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18448src"
href="#xd25e18448" name="xd25e18448src">258</a> and again among the

&agrave; Becket.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18454src" href=
"#xd25e18454" name="xd25e18454src">259</a> Such doubters said little,
leaving it to more zealous reformers to challenge creed with creed.</p>
<p>Freethought in south-western Europe, however, had a measure of
countenance in very high places. In the thirteenth century the Emperor
Frederick II had the repute of being an infidel in the double sense of
being semi-Moslem<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18461src" href=
"#xd25e18461" name="xd25e18461src">260</a> and semi-atheist. By Pope
Gregory IX he was openly charged, in a furious afterthought,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18467src" href="#xd25e18467" name=
"xd25e18467src">261</a> with saying that the world had been deceived by
three impostors (<i lang="it">baratores</i>)&mdash;Moses, Jesus, and
Mohammed; also with putting Jesus much below the other two, and with
delighting to call himself the forerunner of Antichrist.</p>

<p class="first">The Pope&rsquo;s letter, dated July 1, 1239, is given
by Matthew Paris (extracts in Gieseler, vol. iii, &sect; 55), and in
Labbe&rsquo;s <i>Concilia</i>, t. xiii, col. 1157. Cp. the other
references given by Renan, <i lang="fr">Averro&egrave;s</i>, 3e
&eacute;dit. pp. 296&ndash;97. As Voltaire remarks (<i lang="fr">Essai
sur les M&oelig;urs</i>, ch. lii), the Pope&rsquo;s statement is the
basis for the old belief that Frederick had written a treatise dealing
with Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed as <i>The Three Impostors</i>. The
story is certainly a myth; and probably no such book existed in his
century. Cp. Maclaine&rsquo;s note to Mosheim, 13 Cent. pt. i,
<i>end</i>; Renan, <i lang="fr">Averro&egrave;s</i>, pp. 280&ndash;81,
295. The authorship of such a book has nevertheless been ascribed by
Catholic writers successively to Averro&euml;s, Simon of Tournay,
Frederick, his Minister, Pierre des Vignes, Arnaldo de Villanueva,
Boccaccio, Poggio, Pietro Aretino, Machiavelli, Symphorien, Champier,
Pomponazzi, Cardan, Erasmus, Rabelais, Ochinus, Servetus, Postel,
Campanella, Muret, Geoffroi Vall&eacute;e, Giordano Bruno, Dolet,
Hobbes, Spinoza, and Vanini (cp. <i lang="fr">Sentimens sur le

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=

560); and the seventeenth-century apologist Mersenne professed to have
seen it in Arabic (Lea, iii, 297). These references may be dismissed as
worthless. In 1654 the French physician and mathematician Morin wrote
an <i lang="la">Epistola de tribus impostoribus</i> under the name of
Panurge, but this attacked the three contemporary writers Gassendi,
Neure, and Bernier; and in 1680 Kortholt of Kiel published under the
title <i lang="la">De tribus impostoribus magnis</i> an attack on
Herbert, Hobbes, and Spinoza. The <i>Three Impostors</i> current later,
dealing with Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, may have been written about
the same time, but, as we shall see later, is identical with <i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;Esprit de Spinoza</i>, first published in 1719. A Latin
treatise purporting to be written <i lang="la">de tribus famosissimis
deceptoribus</i>, and addressed to an <i lang="la">Otho
illustrissimus</i> (conceivably Otho Duke of Bavaria, 13th c.), came to
light in MS. in 1706, and was described in 1716, but was not printed.
The treatise current later in French cannot have been the same. On the
whole subject see the note of R. C. Christie (reprinted from <i>Notes
and Queries</i>) in his <i>Selected Essays and Papers</i>, 1902, pp.
309, 315; and the full discussion in Reuter&rsquo;s <i lang=
"de">Geschichte der religi&ouml;sen Aufkl&auml;rung</i>, ii,
251&ndash;96. The book <i lang="la">De tribus impostoribus</i>, bearing
the date 1598, of which several copies exist, seems to have been really
published, with its false date, at Vienna in 1753.</p>

had got no further two hundred years later. In the period before the

a certain hardihood of speech on all subjects, which tended to

<p>So, with regard to the belief in magic, there was no general advance
in the later Renaissance on the skepticism of Pietro of Abano, a famous
Paduan physician and Averro&iuml;st, who died, at the age of 80, in
1305. He appears to have denied alike magic and miracles, though he
held fast by astrology, and ascribed the rise and progress of all
religions to the influence of the stars. Himself accused of magic, he
escaped violent death by dying naturally before his trial was ended;
and the Inquisition burned either his body or his image.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18741src" href="#xd25e18741" name=
"xd25e18741src">280</a> After him, superstition seems to have gone step
for step with skepticism.</p>
<p>Dante&rsquo;s own poetic genius, indeed, did much to arrest
intellectual evolution in Italy. Before his time, as we have seen, the
trouv&egrave;res of northern France and the Goliards of the south had
handled hell in a spirit of burlesque; and his own teacher, Brunetto
Latini, had framed a poetic allegory, <i lang="it">Il Tesoretto</i>, in
which Nature figures as the universal power, behind which the God-idea
disappeared.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18764src" href="#xd25e18764"
name="xd25e18764src">281</a> But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327"
href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>Dante&rsquo;s tremendous
vision ultimately effaced all others of the kind; and his intellectual
predominance in virtue of mere imaginative art is at once the great
characteristic and the great anomaly of the early Renaissance. Happily
the inseparable malignity of his pietism was in large part superseded
by a sunnier spirit;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18772src" href=
"#xd25e18772" name="xd25e18772src">282</a> but his personality and his
poetry helped to hold the balance of authority on the side of
faith.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18781src" href="#xd25e18781" name=
"xd25e18781src">283</a> Within a few years of his death there was
burned at Florence (1327) one of the most daring heretics of the later
Middle Ages, <span class="sc">Cecco Stabili d&rsquo;Ascoli</span>, a
professor of philosophy and astrology at Bologna, who is recorded to
have had some intimacy with Dante, and to have been one of his
detractors.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18800src" href="#xd25e18800"

name="xd25e18806src">285</a> and though his science was primitive, the
summing-up is not unwarranted. Combining strong anti-Christian feeling
with the universal belief in astrology, he had declared that Jesus
lived as a sluggard (<i lang="it">come un poltrone</i>) with his
disciples, and died on the cross, under the compulsion of his
star.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18815src" href="#xd25e18815" name=
"xd25e18815src">286</a> In view of the blasphemer&rsquo;s fate, such
audacity was not often repeated.</p>
<p>As against Dante, the great literary influence for tolerance and
liberalism if not rationalism of thought was <span class=
"sc">Boccaccio</span> (1313&ndash;1375), whose
<i>Decameron</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e18831src" href=
"#xd25e18831" name="xd25e18831src">287</a> anticipates every lighter
aspect of the Renaissance&mdash;its levity, its licence, its humour,
its anti-clericalism, its incipient tolerance, its irreverence, its
partial freethinking, as well as its exuberance in the joy of living.
On the side of anti-clericalism, the key-note is struck so strongly and
so defiantly in some of the opening tales that the toleration of the
book by the papal authorities can be accounted for only by their
appreciation of the humour of the stories therein told against them, as
that<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18842src" href="#xd25e18842" name=
"xd25e18842src">288</a> of the Jew who, after seeing the utter
corruption of the clergy at Rome, turned Christian on the score that
only by divine support could such a system survive. No Protestant ever
passed a more scathing aspersion on the whole body of the curia than is
thus set in the forefront of the <i>Decameron</i>. Still more deeply
significant of innovating thought, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328"
href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>however, is the famous story
of <i>The Three Rings</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18858src" href=
"#xd25e18858" name="xd25e18858src">289</a> embodied later by Lessing in
his <i>Nathan the Wise</i> as an apologue of tolerance. Such a story,
introduced with whatever parade of orthodox faith, could not but make
for rational skepticism, summarizing as it does the whole effect of the
inevitable comparison of the rival creeds made by the men of Italy and
those of the east in their intercourse. The story itself, centring on
Saladin, is of eastern origin,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18864src"
href="#xd25e18864" name="xd25e18864src">290</a> and so tells of even
more freethinking than meets the eye in the history of Islam.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18870src" href="#xd25e18870" name=
"xd25e18870src">291</a> It is noteworthy that the Rabbi Simeon Duran
(1360&ndash;1444), who follows on this period, appears to be the first
Jewish teacher to plead for mutual toleration among the conflicting
schools of his race.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18882src" href=
"#xd25e18882" name="xd25e18882src">292</a></p>
<p>Current in Italy before Boccaccio, the tale had been improved from
one Italian hand to another;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18890src" href=
"#xd25e18890" name="xd25e18890src">293</a> and the main credit for its
full development is Boccaccio&rsquo;s.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e18910src" href="#xd25e18910" name="xd25e18910src">294</a> Though
the Church never officially attempted to suppress the
book&mdash;leaving it to Savonarola to destroy as far as possible the
first edition&mdash;the more serious clergy naturally resented its
hostility, first denouncing it, then seeking to expurgate all the
anti-clerical passages;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18919src" href=
"#xd25e18919" name="xd25e18919src">295</a> and the personal pressure
brought to bear upon Boccaccio had the effect of dispiriting and
puritanizing him; so that the <i>Decameron</i> finally wrought its
effect in its author&rsquo;s despite.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e18925src" href="#xd25e18925" name="xd25e18925src">296</a> So far
as we can divine the deeper influence of such a work on medieval
thought, it may reasonably be supposed to have tended, like that of
Averro&iuml;sm, towards Unitarianism or deism, inasmuch as a simple
belief in deity is all that is normally implied in its language on
religious matters. On that view it bore its full intellectual fruit
only in the two succeeding centuries, when deism and Unitarianism alike
grew up in Italy, apparently from non-scholastic roots.</p>
<p>It is an interesting problem how far the vast calamity of the Black
Death (1348&ndash;49) told either for skepticism or for superstition
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>in this age. In Boccaccio&rsquo;s immortal book
we see a few refined Florentines who flee the pest giving themselves up
to literary amusement; but there is also mention of many who had taken
to wild debauchery, and there are many evidences as to wild outbreaks
of desperate licence all over Europe.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e18942src" href="#xd25e18942" name="xd25e18942src">297</a> On the
other hand, many were driven by fear to religious practices;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e18948src" href="#xd25e18948" name=
"xd25e18948src">298</a> and in the immense destruction of life the
Church acquired much new wealth. At the same time the multitudes of
priests who died<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18953src" href=
"#xd25e18953" name="xd25e18953src">299</a> had as a rule to be replaced
by ill-trained persons, where the problem was not solved by creating
pluralities, the result being a general falling-off in the culture and
the authority of the clergy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18959src" href=
"#xd25e18959" name="xd25e18959src">300</a> But there seems to have been
little or no growth of such questioning as came later from the
previously optimistic Voltaire after the earthquake of Lisbon; and the
total effect of the immense reduction of population all over Europe
seems to have been a lowering of the whole of the activities of life.
Certainly the students of Paris in 1376 were surprisingly freethinking
on scriptural points;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e18965src" href=
"#xd25e18965" name="xd25e18965src">301</a> but there is nothing to show
that the great pestilence had set up any new movement of ethical
thought. In some ways it grievously deepened bigotry, as in regard to
the Jews, who were in many regions madly impeached as having caused the
plague by poisoning the wells, and were then massacred in large
numbers.</p>
<p>Side by side with Boccaccio, his friend <span class=
"sc">Petrarch</span> (1304&ndash;1374), who with him completes the
great literary trio of the late Middle Ages, belongs to freethought in
that he too, with less aggressiveness but also without recoil, stood
for independent culture and a rational habit of mind as against the
dogmatics and tyrannies of the Church.<a class="noteref" id=

in the main a practical humanist, not in accord with the verbalizing

the churchmen were for their dogmas;<a class="noteref" id=

rule of reason in all things<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19013src" href=
"#xd25e19013" name="xd25e19013src">308</a> it was not that he was a
deeply searching rationalist, but that he was spontaneously averse to
all the extremes of thought around him, and was concerned to discredit
them. For himself, having little speculative power, he was disposed to
fall back on a simple and tolerant Christianity. Thus he is quite
unsympathetic in his references to those scholars of his day who
privately indicated their unbelief. Knowing nothing of the teaching of
Averro&euml;s, he speaks of him, on the strength of Christian fictions,
as &ldquo;that mad dog who, moved by an execrable rage, barks against
his Lord Christ and the Catholic faith.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

from such conventional <i lang="la">odium theologicum</i>, his
judgment, like his literary art, was clear and restrained; opening no

<p>Between such humanistic influences and that of more systematic and
scholastic thought, Italy in that age was the chief source of practical
criticism of Christian dogmas; and the extent to which a unitarian
theism was now connected with the acceptance of the philosophy of
Averro&euml;s brought it about, despite the respectful attitude of
Dante, who gave him a tranquil place in hell,<a class="noteref" id=

tended there to undergo the usual scholastic petrifaction; and the
common-sense deism it encouraged outside had to subsist without
literary discipline. In this form it probably reached many lands,
without openly affecting culture or life; since Averro&iuml;sm itself
was professed generally in the Carmelite order, who claimed for it
orthodoxy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19055src" href="#xd25e19055"
name="xd25e19055src">314</a></p>
<p>Alongside, however, of intellectual solvents, there were at work
others of a more widely effective kind, set up by the long and sinister
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>historic episode of the Great Papal Schism. The
Church, already profoundly discredited in the eleventh century by the
gross disorders of the papacy, continued frequently throughout the
twelfth to exhibit the old spectacle of rival popes; and late in the
fourteenth (1378) there broke out the greatest schism of all.
Ostensibly beginning in a riotous coercion of the electing cardinals by
the Roman populace, it was maintained on the one side by the standing
interest of the clergy in Italy, which called for an Italian head of
the Church, and on the other hand by the French interest, which had
already enforced the residence of the popes at Avignon from 1305 to
1376. It was natural that, just after the papal chair had been replaced
in Italy by Gregory IX, the Romans should threaten violence to the
cardinals if they chose any but an Italian; and no less natural that
the French court should determine to restore a state of things in which
it controlled the papacy in all save its corruption. During the seventy
years of &ldquo;the Captivity,&rdquo; Rome had sunk to the condition of
a poor country town; and to the Italian clergy the struggle for a
restoration was a matter of economic life and death. For thirty-nine
years did the schism last, being ended only by the prolonged action of
the great Council of Constance in deposing the rivals of the moment and
appointing Martin V (1417); and this was achieved only after there had
slipped into the chair of Peter &ldquo;the most worthless and infamous
man to be found.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19064src" href=
"#xd25e19064" name="xd25e19064src">315</a> During the schism every
species of scandal had flourished. Indulgences had been sold and

rivals in avarice, indecorum, and reciprocal execration; and in

<p class="first">Despite, therefore, the premium put by the Church on
devotion to its cause and doctrine, and despite its success in
strangling specific forms of heresy, hostility to its own pretensions
germinated everywhere,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19101src" href=
"#xd25e19101" name="xd25e19101src">319</a> especially in the countries
most alien to Italy in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href=

accomplished Catholic scholar<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19117src"
href="#xd25e19117" name="xd25e19117src">320</a> sums up that
&ldquo;from about the middle of the twelfth century the whole secular
and religious literature of Europe grew more and more hostile to the
papacy and the curia.&rdquo; The Church&rsquo;s own economic
conditions, constantly turning its priesthood, despite all precautions,
into a money-making and shamelessly avaricious class, ensured it a
perpetuity of ill-will and denunciation. The popular literature which
now began to grow throughout Christendom with the spread of political
order was everywhere turned to the account of anti-clerical
satire;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19122src" href="#xd25e19122" name=
"xd25e19122src">321</a> and only the defect of real knowledge secured
by the Church&rsquo;s own policy prevented such hostility from
developing into rational unbelief. As it was, a tendency to criticize
at once the socio-economic code and practice and the details of creed
and worship is seen in a series of movements from the thirteenth
century onwards; and some of the most popular literature of that age is
deeply tinged with the new spirit. After the overthrow of the
well-organized anti-clericalism of the Cathari and other heretics in
Languedoc, however, no movement equally systematic and equally
heretical flourished on any large scale; and as even those heresies on
their popular side were essentially supernaturalist, and tended to set
up one hierarchy in place of another, it would be vain to look for
anything like a consistent or searching rationalism among the people in
the period broadly termed medieval, including the Renaissance.</p>
<p>It would be a bad misconception to infer from the abundant signs of
popular disrespect for the clergy that the mass of the laity even in
Italy, for instance, were unbelievers.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19130src" href="#xd25e19130" name="xd25e19130src">322</a> They
never were anything of the kind. At all times they were deeply
superstitious, easily swayed by religious emotion, credulous as to
relics, miracles, visions, prophecies, responsive to pulpit eloquence,
readily passing from derision of worldly priests to worship of austere
ones.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19133src" href="#xd25e19133" name=
"xd25e19133src">323</a> When Machiavelli said that religion was gone
from Italy, he was thinking of the upper classes, among whom theism was
normal,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19142src" href="#xd25e19142" name=
"xd25e19142src">324</a> and the upper clergy, who were often at once
superstitious and corrupt. As for the common people, it was impossible
that they should be grounded rationalists as regarded the great
problems of life. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href=
"#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>were merely the raw material on
which knowledge might work if it could reach them, which it never did.
And the common people everywhere else stood at or below the culture
level of those of Italy.</p>
<p>For lack of other culture than Biblical, then, even the popular
heresy tended to run into mysticisms which were only so far more
rational than the dogmas and rites of the Church that they stood for
some actual reflection. A partial exception, indeed, may be made in the
case of the Brethren of the Free Spirit, a sect set up in Germany in
the early years of the thirteenth century, by one Ortlieb, on the basis
of the pantheistic teachings of Amaury of B&egrave;ne and David of
Dinant.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19152src" href="#xd25e19152" name=
"xd25e19152src">325</a> Their doctrines were set forth in a special
treatise or sacred book, called <i>The Nine Rocks</i>. The <i lang=
"la">Fratres liberi spiritus</i> seem to have been identical with the
sect of the &ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19166src" href="#xd25e19166" name="xd25e19166src">326</a> but
their tenets were heretical in a high degree, including as they did a
denial of personal immortality, and consequently of the notions of
heaven, hell, and purgatory. Even the sect&rsquo;s doctrine of the Holy
Spirit was heretical in another way, inasmuch as it ran, if its
opponents can be believed, to the old antinomian assertion that anyone
filled with the Spirit was sinless, whatever deeds he might
do.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19169src" href="#xd25e19169" name=
"xd25e19169src">327</a> As always, such antinomianism strengthened the
hands of the clergy against the heresy, though the Brethren seem to
have been originally very ascetic; and inasmuch as their pantheism
involved the idea that Satan also had in him the divine essence, they
were duly accused of devil-worship.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19182src" href="#xd25e19182" name="xd25e19182src">328</a> On
general principles they were furiously persecuted; but all through the

are found in various parts of central and western Europe,<a class=

"xd25e19185src">329</a> often in close alliance with the originally
orthodox communities known in France and Holland by the names of
<i>Turlupins</i> and <i>Beguins</i> or <i>Beguines</i>, and in Germany
and Belgium as <i>Begutt&aelig;</i> or <i>Beghards</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e19207src" href="#xd25e19207" name=
"xd25e19207src">330</a> akin to the Lollards.</p>
<p>These in turn are to be understood in connection with developments
which took place in the thirteenth century within the
Church&mdash;notably the rise of the great orders of Mendicant Friars,
of which the two chief were founded about 1216 by Francis of Assisi and
the Spanish Dominic, the latter a fierce persecutor in the Albigensian
crusade. Nothing availed more to preserve or restore for a time the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>Church&rsquo;s prestige. The old criticism of
priestly and monastic avarice and worldliness was disarmed by the
sudden appearance and rapid spread of a priesthood and brotherhood of
poverty; and the obvious devotion of thousands of the earlier adherents
went to the general credit of the Church. Yet the descent of the new
orders to the moral and economic levels of the old was only a question
of time; and no process could more clearly illustrate the futility of
all schemes of regenerating the world on non-rational principles. Apart
from the vast encouragement given to sheer mendicancy among the poor,
the orders themselves substantially apostatized from their own rules
within a generation.</p>
<p>The history of the Franciscans in particular is like that of the
Church in general&mdash;one of rapid lapse into furious schism, with a
general reversion to gross self-seeking on the part of the majority,
originally vowed to utter poverty. Elias, the first successor of
Francis, appointed by the Saint himself, proved an intolerable tyrant;
and in his day began the ferocious strife between the
&ldquo;Spirituals,&rdquo; who insisted on the founder&rsquo;s ideal of
poverty, and the majority, who insisted on accepting the wealth which
the world either bestowed or could be cajoled into bestowing on the
order. The majority, of course, ultimately overbore the Spirituals, the
papacy supporting them.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19235src" href=
"#xd25e19235" name="xd25e19235src">331</a> They followed the
practically universal law of monastic life. The <i>Humiliati</i>,
founded before the thirteenth century, had to be suppressed by the Pope
in the sixteenth, for sheer corruption of morals; and the Franciscans
and Dominicans, who speedily became bitterly hostile to each other,
were in large measure little better. Even in the middle of the
thirteenth century they were attacked by the Sorbonne doctor, William
of St. Amour, in a book on <i>The Perils of the Latter
Times</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19247src" href="#xd25e19247"
name="xd25e19247src">332</a> and in England in the fourteenth century
we find Wiclif assailing the begging friars as the earlier satirists
had assailed the abbots and monks. That all this reciprocal invective
was not mere partizan calumny, but broadly true as against both sides,
is the conclusion forced upon a reader of the <i>Philobiblon</i>
ascribed to Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham and Treasurer and
Chancellor under Edward III. In that book, written either by the bishop
or by one of his chaplains, Robert Holkot,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19260src" href="#xd25e19260" name="xd25e19260src">333</a> the
demerits of all orders of the clergy from the points of view of letters
and morals are set forth with impartial emphasis;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19266src" href="#xd25e19266" name="xd25e19266src">334</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>and the character of the bishop in turn is no
less effectively disposed of after his death by Adam Murimuth, a
distinguished lawyer and canon of St. Paul&rsquo;s.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19280src" href="#xd25e19280" name="xd25e19280src">335</a></p>
<p>The worst of the trouble for the Church was that the mendicants were
detested by bishops and the beneficed priests, whose credit they
undermined, and whose revenues they intercepted. That the Franciscans
and Dominicans remained socially powerful till the Reformation was due
to the energy developed by their corporate organization and the measure
of education they soon secured on their own behalf; not to any general
superiority on their part to the &ldquo;secular&rdquo; clergy
so-called.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19285src" href="#xd25e19285"
name="xd25e19285src">336</a> Indeed it was to the latter, within the
Church, that most pre-Reformation reformers looked for sympathy. At the
outset, however, the movement of the Mendicant Friars gave a great
impulsion to the lay communities of the type of the Beguines and
Beghards who had originated in the Netherlands, and who practised at
once mendicancy and charity very much on the early Franciscan
lines;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19317src" href="#xd25e19317" name=
"xd25e19317src">337</a> and the spirit of innovation led in both cases
to forms of heresy. That of the Beguines and Beghards arose mainly
through their association with the Brethren of the Free Spirit; and
they suffered persecution as did the latter; while among the
&ldquo;Spiritual&rdquo; Franciscans, who were despisers of learning,
there arose a species of new religion. At the beginning of the century,
Abbot Joachim, of Flora or Flores in Calabria (d. 1202), who &ldquo;may
be regarded as the founder of modern mysticism,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e19323src" href="#xd25e19323" name=
"xd25e19323src">338</a> had earned a great reputation by devout
austerities, and a greater by his vaticinations,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19326src" href="#xd25e19326" name="xd25e19326src">339</a> which
he declared to be divine. One of his writings was condemned as
heretical, thirteen years after his death, by the Council of Lateran;
but his apocalyptic writings, and others put out in his name, had a
great vogue among the rebellious Franciscans.</p>
<p>At length, in 1254, there was produced in Paris a book called <i>The
Everlasting Gospel</i>, consisting of three of his genuine works, with
a long and audacious Introduction by an anonymous hand, which expressed
a spirit of innovation and revolt, mystical rather than rational, that
seemed to promise the utter disruption of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>Church. It declared that, as the dispensation of
the Son had followed on that of the Father, so Christ&rsquo;s evangel
in turn was to be superseded by that of the &ldquo;Holy
Spirit.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19339src" href="#xd25e19339"
name="xd25e19339src">340</a> Adopted by the &ldquo;Spiritual&rdquo;
section of the Franciscans, it brought heresy within the organization
itself, the <i>Introduction</i> being by many ascribed&mdash;probably
in error&mdash;to the head of the order, John of Parma, a devotee of
Joachim. On other grounds, he was ultimately deposed;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19357src" href="#xd25e19357" name="xd25e19357src">341</a> but
the ferment of heresy was great. And while the Franciscans are commonly
reputed to have been led by small-minded generals,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19361src" href="#xd25e19361" name="xd25e19361src">342</a>
their order, as Renan notes,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19370src" href=
"#xd25e19370" name="xd25e19370src">343</a> not only never lost the
stamp of its popular and irregular origin, but was always less orthodox
in general than the Dominican. But its deviations were rather
ultra-religious than rational; and some of its heresies have become
orthodoxy. Thus it was the Franciscans, notably Duns Scotus, who
carried the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin against
the Dominicans, who held by the teaching of Thomas Aquinas that she was
conceived &ldquo;in sin.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19375src"
href="#xd25e19375" name="xd25e19375src">344</a> Mary was thus deified
on a popular impulse, dating from paganism, at the expense of
Christism; and, considering that both Thomas and St. Bernard had flatly
rejected the Immaculate Conception, its ultimate adoption as dogma is
highly significant.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19381src" href=
"#xd25e19381" name="xd25e19381src">345</a></p>
<p>In the year 1260, when, according to the &ldquo;Eternal
Gospel,&rdquo; the new dispensation of the Holy Spirit was to begin,
there was an immense excitement in northern Italy, marked by the
outbreak of the order of Flagellants, self-scourgers, whose hysteria
spread to other lands. Gherardo Segarelli, a youth of Parma, came
forward as a new Christ, had himself circumcised, swaddled, cradled,
and suckled;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19389src" href="#xd25e19389"
name="xd25e19389src">346</a> and proceeded to found a new order of
&ldquo;Apostolicals,&rdquo; after the manner of a sect of the previous
century, known by the same name, who professed to return to primitive
simplicity and to chastity, and reproduced what they supposed to be the
morals of the early Church, including the profession of ascetic
cohabitation.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19392src" href="#xd25e19392"
name="xd25e19392src">347</a> Some of their missionaries got as far as
Germany; but Segarelli was caught, imprisoned, reduced to the status of
a bishop&rsquo;s jester, and at length, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>after saving his life
for a time by abjuration, burned at Parma, in the year 1300.</p>
<p>Despite much persecution of the order, one of its adherents, Fra
Dolcino, immediately began to exploit Segarelli&rsquo;s martyrdom, and
renewed the movement by an adaptation of the &ldquo;Eternal
Gospel,&rdquo; announcing that Segarelli had begun a new era, to last
till the Day of Judgment. Predicting the formation of native states, as
well as the forcible purification of the papacy, he ultimately set up
an armed movement, which held out in the southern Alps for two years,
till the Apostolicals were reduced to cannibalism. At length (1307)
they were overpowered and massacred, and Dolcino was captured, with his
beautiful and devoted companion, Margherita di Trank. She was slowly
burned to death before his eyes, refusing to abjure; and he in turn was
gradually tortured to death, uttering no cry.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19405src" href="#xd25e19405" name="xd25e19405src">348</a></p>
<p>The order subsisted for a time in secret, numbers cherishing
Dolcino&rsquo;s memory, and practising a priestless and riteless
religion, prohibiting oaths, and wholly repudiating every claim of the
Church.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19410src" href="#xd25e19410" name=
"xd25e19410src">349</a> Yet another sect, called by the name of
&ldquo;The Spirit of Liberty&rdquo;&mdash;probably the origin of the
name <i lang="it">libertini</i>, later applied to freethinkers in
France&mdash;was linked on the one hand to the Apostolicals and on the
other to the German Brethren of the Free Spirit, as well as to the
Franciscan <i lang="it">Fraticelli</i>. This sect is heard of as late
as 1344, when one of its members was burned.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19428src" href="#xd25e19428" name="xd25e19428src">350</a> And
there were yet others; till it seemed as if the Latin Church were to be
resolved into an endless series of schisms. But organization, as of
old, prevailed; the cohesive and aggressive force of the central
system, with the natural strifes of the new movements, whether within
or without<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19431src" href="#xd25e19431"
name="xd25e19431src">351</a> the Church, sufficed to bring about their
absorption or their destruction. It needed a special concurrence of
economic, political, and culture forces to disrupt the fabric of the
papacy.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of all the chapters in the history of the Inquisition,
the most tragical is the record of its work in Spain, for there a whole
nation&rsquo;s faculty of freethought was by its ministry strangled for
a whole era. There is a prevalent notion that in Spain fanaticism had
mastered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>the national life from the period of the
overthrow of Arianism under the later Visigothic kings; and that there
the extirpation of heresy was the spontaneous and congenial work of the
bulk of the nation, giving vent to the spirit of intolerance ingrained
in it in the long war with the Moors. &ldquo;Spain,&rdquo; says
Michelet, &ldquo;has always felt herself more Catholic than
Rome.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19447src" href="#xd25e19447"
name="xd25e19447src">352</a> But this is a serious misconception. Wars
associated with a religious cause are usually followed rather by
indifference than by increased faith; and the long wars of the Moors
and the Christians in Spain had some such sequel,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19455src" href="#xd25e19455" name="xd25e19455src">353</a> as had
the Crusades, and the later wars of religion in France and Germany. It
is true that for a century after the (political) conversion of the
Visigothic king Recared (587) from Arianism to Catholicism&mdash;an age
of complete decadence&mdash;the policy of the Spanish Church was
extremely intolerant, as might have been expected. The Jews, in
particular, were repeatedly and murderously persecuted;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e19458src" href="#xd25e19458" name=
"xd25e19458src">354</a> but after the fall of the Visigoths before the
invading Moors, the treatment of all forms of heresy in the Christian
parts of the Peninsula, down to the establishment of the second or New
Inquisition under Torquemada, was in general rather less severe than
elsewhere.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19464src" href="#xd25e19464"
name="xd25e19464src">355</a></p>
<p>An exception is to be noted in the case of the edicts of 1194 and
1197, by Alfonso II and Pedro II (&ldquo;the Catholic&rdquo;) of
Aragon, against the Waldenses.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19472src"
href="#xd25e19472" name="xd25e19472src">356</a> The policy in the first
case was that of wholesale expulsion of the heretics anathematized by
the Church; and, as this laid the victims open to plunder all round,
there is a presumption that cupidity was a main part of the motive.
Peter the Catholic, in turn, who decreed the stake for the heretics
that remained, made a signally complete capitulation to the Holy See;
but the nation did not support him; and the tribute he promised to pay
to the Pope was never paid.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19478src" href=
"#xd25e19478" name="xd25e19478src">357</a> In the thirteenth century,
when the Moors had been driven out of Castile, rationalistic heresy
seems to have been as common in Spain as in Italy. Already Arab culture
had spread, Archbishop Raymond of Toledo (1130&ndash;50) having caused
many books to be translated from Arabic into Latin;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19481src" href="#xd25e19481" name="xd25e19481src">358</a> and

Christians and Moors,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19487src" href=
"#xd25e19487" name="xd25e19487src">359</a> the Averro&iuml;st influence
which so speedily reached Sicily from Toledo through Michael Scot must
have counted for something in Spain. About 1260 Alfonso X, &ldquo;the
Wise&rdquo; king of Castile, describes the heresies of his kingdom
under <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=

denial of a future state of rewards and punishments.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19495src" href="#xd25e19495" name="xd25e19495src">360</a> This
heresy, further, is proceeded against by the Council of Tarragona in
1291. And though Alfonso was orthodox, and in his legislation a

<p>As late as the latter half of the fifteenth century, within a
generation of the setting-up of the murderous New Inquisition, Spain
seems to have been on the whole as much given to freethinking as
France, and much more so than England. On the one hand, Averro&iuml;sm
tinged somewhat the intellectual life through the Moorish environment,
so that in 1464 we find revolted nobles complaining that King Enrique
IV is suspected of being unsound in the faith because he has about him
both enemies of Catholicism and nominal Christians who avow their
disbelief in a future state.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19566src" href=
"#xd25e19566" name="xd25e19566src">374</a> On the other hand, it had
been noted that many were beginning to deny the need or efficacy of
priestly confession; and about 1478 a Professor at Salamanca, Pedro de
Osma, actually printed an argument to that effect, further challenging
the power of the Pope. So slight was then the machinery of inquisition
that he had to be publicly tried by a council, which merely ordered him
to recant in public; and he died peacefully in 1480.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19569src" href="#xd25e19569" name="xd25e19569src">375</a></p>
<p>It was immediately after this, in the reign of Ferdinand and
Isabella, that the Inquisition was newly and effectively established in
Spain; and the determining motive was the avarice of the king and
queen, not the Catholic zeal of the people. The Inquisitor-General of
Messina came to Madrid in 1477 in order to obtain confirmation of a
forged privilege, pretended to have been granted to the Dominicans in
Sicily by Frederick II in 1233&mdash;that of receiving one-third of the
property of every heretic they condemned. To such a ruler as Ferdinand,
such a system readily appealed; and as soon as possible a new
Inquisition was established in Spain, Isabella consenting.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e19576src" href="#xd25e19576" name=
"xd25e19576src">376</a> From the first it was a system of plunder.
&ldquo;Men long dead, if they were represented by rich descendants,
were cited before the tribunal, judged, and condemned; and the lands
and goods that had descended to their heirs passed into the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name=

falsehood.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19584src" href=
"#xd25e19584" name="xd25e19584src">378</a> The revenue thus
iniquitously obtained was enormous; and it is inferrible that the
pecuniary motive underlay the later expulsion of the Jews and the
Moriscoes as well as the average practice of the Inquisition.</p>

<p class="first">The error as to the original or anciently ingrained
fanaticism of the Spanish people, first made current by Ticknor
(<i>Hist. Spanish Lit.</i><span class="corr" id="xd25e19597" title=
"Not in source">,</span> 6th ed. i, 505), has been to some extent
diffused by Buckle, who at this point of his inquiry reasoned &agrave;
priori instead of inductively as his own principles prescribed. See the
notes to the present writer&rsquo;s edition of his <i>Introduction</i>
(Routledge, 1904), pp. 107, 534&ndash;50. The special atrocity of the
Inquisition in Spain was not even due directly to the papacy (cp.
Burke, ii, 78): it was the result first of the rapacity of Ferdinand,
utilizing a papal institution; and later of the <i>political</i>
fanaticisms of Charles V and Philip II, both of Teutonic as well as
Spanish descent. Philip alleged that the Inquisition in the Netherlands
was more severe than in Spain (ed. of Buckle cited, p. 107,
<i>note</i>). In the words of Bishop Stubbs: &ldquo;To a German race of
sovereigns Spain finally owed the subversion of her national system and
ancient freedom&rdquo; (<i>id.</i> p. 550, <i>note</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a process, however, would not have been possible in any
country, at any stage of the world&rsquo;s history, without the
initiative and the support of some such sacrosanct organization as the
Catholic Church, wielding a spell over the minds even of those who, in
terror and despair, fought against it. As in the thirteenth century, so
at the end of the fifteenth,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19619src" href=
"#xd25e19619" name="xd25e19619src">379</a> the Inquisition in Spain was
spasmodically resisted in Aragon and Castile, in Catalonia, and in
Valencia; the first Inquisitor-General in Aragon being actually slain
in the cathedral of Saragossa in 1487, despite his precaution of
wearing a steel cap and coat of mail.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19625src" href="#xd25e19625" name="xd25e19625src">380</a>
Vigorous protests from the Cort&egrave;s even forced some restraint
upon the entire machine; but such occasional resistance could not long
countervail the steady pressure of regal and official avarice and the
systematic fanaticism of the Dominican order.</p>
<p>It was thus the fate of Spain to illustrate once for all the power
of a dogmatic religious system to extirpate the spirit of reason from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>an entire nation for a whole era. There and
there only, save for a time in Italy, did the Inquisition become
all-powerful; and it wrought for the evisceration of the intellectual
and material life of Spain with a demented zeal to which there is no
parallel in later history. In the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,
after several random massacres and much persecution of the &ldquo;New
Christians&rdquo; or doubtful converts from Judaism,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19634src" href="#xd25e19634" name="xd25e19634src">381</a> the
unconverted Jews of Spain were in 1489 penned into Ghettos, and were in
1492 expelled bodily from the country, with every circumstance of
cruelty, so far as Church and State could compass their plans. By this
measure at least 160,000 subjects<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19643src"
href="#xd25e19643" name="xd25e19643src">382</a> of more than average
value were lost to the State. Portugal and other Christian countries
took the same cruel step a few years later; but Spain carried the
policy much further. From the year of its establishment, the
Inquisition was hotly at work destroying heresy of every kind; and the
renowned Torquemada, the confessor of Isabella, is credited with having
burned over ten thousand persons in his eighteen years of office as
Grand Inquisitor, besides torturing many thousands. Close upon a
hundred thousand more were terrified into submission; and a further six
thousand burned in effigy in their absence or after death.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e19655src" href="#xd25e19655" name=
"xd25e19655src">383</a> The destruction of books was proportionally
thorough;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19664src" href="#xd25e19664" name=
"xd25e19664src">384</a> and when Lutheran Protestantism arose it was
persistently killed out; thousands leaving the country in view of the
hopelessness of the cause.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19668src" href=
"#xd25e19668" name="xd25e19668src">385</a> At this rate, every vestige
of independent thought must soon have disappeared from any nation in
the world. If she is to be judged by the number of her slain and exiled
heretics, Spain must once have been nearly as fecund in reformative and
innovating thought as any State in northern Europe; but the fatal
conjunction of the royal and the clerical authority sufficed for a
whole era to denude her of every variety of the freethinking
species.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19674src" href="#xd25e19674" name=

<p class="first">Lying on the outskirts of the world of culture,
England in the later Middle Ages and the period of the Italian
Renaissance lived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343"
name="pb343">343</a>]</span>intellectually, even where ministered to by
the genius of Chaucer, for the most part in dependence on Continental
impulses; yet not without notable outcrops of native energy. There is
indeed no more remarkable figure in the Middle Ages than <span class=
"sc">Roger Bacon</span> (? 1214&ndash;1294), the English Franciscan
friar, schooled at Paris. His career remains still in parts obscure.
Born at or near Ilchester, in Somersetshire, he studied at Oxford under
Edmund Rich, Richard Fitzacre, Robert Grosst&ecirc;te, and Adam de
Marisco; and later, for a number of years, at Paris, where he is
supposed to have held a chair. On his return he was lionized; but a few
years afterwards, in 1257, we find him again in Paris, banished thither
by his Order.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19689src" href="#xd25e19689"
name="xd25e19689src">387</a> He was not absolutely imprisoned, but
ordered to live under official surveillance in a dwelling where he was
forbidden to write, to speak to novices, or observe the
stars&mdash;rules which, it is pretty clear, he broke, one and
all.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19695src" href="#xd25e19695" name=
"xd25e19695src">388</a> After some eight years of this durance,
Cardinal Guido Falcodi (otherwise Guy Foucaud or De Foulques), who
while acting as papal legate in England at the time of the rising of
Simon de Montfort may have known or heard of Bacon, became interested
in him through his chaplain, Raymond of Laon, who spoke (in error) of
the imprisoned friar as having written much on science. The cardinal
accordingly wrote asking to see the writings in question. Bacon sent by
a friend an explanation to the effect that he had written little, and
that he could not devote himself to composition without a written
mandate and a papal dispensation. About this time the Cardinal was
elevated to the papacy as Clement IV; and in that capacity, a year
later (1266), he wrote to Bacon authorizing him to disobey his
superior, but exhorting him to do it secretly. Bacon, by his own
account, had already spent in forty years of study 2,000
<i>libri</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e19703src" href="#xd25e19703"
name="xd25e19703src">389</a> in addition to purchases of books and
instruments and teacher&rsquo;s fees; and it is not known whether the
Pope furnished the supplies he declared he needed.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19713src" href="#xd25e19713" name="xd25e19713src">390</a> To
work, however, he went with an astonishing industry, and in the course
of less than eighteen months<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19719src" href=
"#xd25e19719" name="xd25e19719src">391</a> he had produced his chief
treatise, the <i lang="la">Opus Majus</i>; the <i lang="la">Opus
Minus</i>, designed as a summary or sample of the former; and the later
<i lang="la">Opus Tertium</i>, planned to serve as a preamble to the
two others.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19733src" href="#xd25e19733"
name="xd25e19733src">392</a></p>
<p>Through all three documents there runs the same inspiration, the
<i lang="la">Opus Tertium</i> and the <i lang="la">Majus</i>
constituting a complete treatise, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344"
href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>which gives at once the most
vivid idea of the state of culture at the time, and the most intimate
presentment of a student&rsquo;s mind, that survive from the thirteenth
century. It was nothing less than a demand, such as was made by Francis
Bacon three hundred and fifty years later, and by Auguste Comte in the
nineteenth century, for a reconstruction of all studies and all
tuition. Neither pope nor emperor could have met it; but Clement gave
Roger his freedom, and he returned to Oxford, papally protected, at the
end of 1267. Four years later Clement died, and was succeeded by
Gregory X, a Franciscan.</p>
<p>At this stage of his life Bacon revealed that, whatever were his
wrongs, he was inclined to go halfway to meet them. In a new writing of
similar purport with the others, the <i lang="la">Compendium
Philosophi&aelig;</i>, written in 1271,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19755src" href="#xd25e19755" name="xd25e19755src">393</a> he not
only attacked in detail the ecclesiastical system,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19760src" href="#xd25e19760" name="xd25e19760src">394</a> but
argued that the Christians were incomparably inferior to pagans in
morals, and therefore in science;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19770src"
href="#xd25e19770" name="xd25e19770src">395</a> that there was more
truth in Aristotle&rsquo;s few chapters on laws than in the whole
<i lang="la">corpus juris</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19779src"
href="#xd25e19779" name="xd25e19779src">396</a> that the Christian
religion, as commonly taught, was not free of errors; and that
philosophy truly taught, and not as in the schools, was perhaps the
surer way to attain both truth and salvation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19784src" href="#xd25e19784" name="xd25e19784src">397</a></p>
<p>Again he was prosecuted; and this time, after much delay, it was
decided that the entire Order should deal with the case. Not till 1277
did the trial come off, under the presidency of the chief of the Order,
Jerome of Ascoli. Bacon was bracketed with another insubordinate
brother, Jean d&rsquo;Olive; and both were condemned. In Bacon&rsquo;s
case his doctrine was specified as <i lang="la">continentem aliquas
novitates suspectas, propter quas fuit idem Rogerius carceri
condempnatus</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19794src" href=
"#xd25e19794" name="xd25e19794src">398</a> This time Bacon seems to
have undergone a real imprisonment, which lasted fourteen years. During
that time four more popes held office, the last of them being the said
Jerome, elevated to the papal chair as Nicholas IV. Not till his death
in 1292 was Bacon released&mdash;to die two years later.</p>
<p>He was in fact, with all his dogmatic orthodoxy, too essentially in
advance of his age to be otherwise than suspect to the typical
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>ecclesiastics of any time. The marvel is that
with his radical skepticism as to all forms of human knowledge; his
intense perception of the fatality of alternate credulity and
indifference which kept most men in a state of positive or negative
error on every theme; his insatiable thirst for knowledge; his
invincible repugnance to all acknowledgment of authority,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e19810src" href="#xd25e19810" name=
"xd25e19810src">399</a> and his insistence on an ethical end, he should
have been able to rest as he did in the assumption of a divine
infallibility vested in what he knew to be a corruptible text. It was
doubtless defect of strictly philosophic thought, as distinguished from
practical critical faculty, that enabled him to remain orthodox in
theology while anti-authoritarian in everything else. As it was, his
recalcitrance to authority in such an age sufficed to make his life a
warfare upon earth. And it is not surprising that, even as his
Franciscan predecessor Robert Grosst&ecirc;te, bishop of Lincoln, came
to be reputed a sorcerer on the strength of having written many
treatises on scientific questions&mdash;as well as on
witchcraft&mdash;Roger Bacon became a wizard in popular legend, and a
scandal in the eyes of his immediate superiors, for a zest of secular
curiosity no less uncommon and unpriestlike.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19813src" href="#xd25e19813" name="xd25e19813src">400</a>
&ldquo;It is sometimes impossible to avoid smiling,&rdquo; says one
philosophic historian of him, &ldquo;when one sees how artfully this
personified thirst for knowledge seeks to persuade himself, or his
readers, that knowledge interests him only for ecclesiastical ends. No
one has believed it: neither posterity &hellip; nor his contemporaries,
who distrusted him as worldly-minded.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19822src" href="#xd25e19822" name="xd25e19822src">401</a></p>
<p>Worldly-minded he was in a noble sense, as seeking to know the world
of Nature; and perhaps the most remarkable proof of his originality on
this side is his acceptance of the theory of the earth&rsquo;s
sphericity. Peter de Alliaco, whose <i lang="la">Imago Mundi</i> was
compiled in 1410, transcribed from Roger Bacon&rsquo;s <i lang=
"la">Opus Majus</i> almost literally, but without acknowledgment, a
passage containing quotations from Aristotle, Pliny, and Seneca, all
arguing for the possibility of reaching India by sailing westward.
Columbus, it is known, was familiar with the <i lang="la">Imago
Mundi</i>; and this passage seems greatly to have inspired him in his
task.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19839src" href="#xd25e19839" name=
"xd25e19839src">402</a> This alone was sufficient practical heresy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>to put Bacon in danger; and yet his real
orthodoxy can hardly be doubted.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19872src"
href="#xd25e19872" name="xd25e19872src">403</a> He always protested
against the scholastic doctrine of a &ldquo;twofold truth,&rdquo;
insisting that revelation and philosophy were at one, but that the
latter also was divine.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19875src" href=
"#xd25e19875" name="xd25e19875src">404</a> It probably mattered little
to his superiors, however, what view he took of the abstract question:
it was his zeal for concrete knowledge that they detested. His works
remain to show the scientific reach of which his age was capable, when
helped by the lore of the Arabs; for he seems to have drawn from
Averro&euml;s some of his inspiration to research;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19880src" href="#xd25e19880" name="xd25e19880src">405</a> but
in the England of that day his ideals of research were as unattainable
as his wrath against clerical obstruction was powerless;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e19892src" href="#xd25e19892" name=
"xd25e19892src">406</a> and Averro&iuml;sm in England made little for

name="xd25e19904src">407</a> The English Renaissance properly sets-in
in the latter half of the sixteenth century, when the glory of that of
Italy is passing away.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century, indeed, a remarkable new life is seen
arising in England in the poetry and prose of Chaucer, from contact
with the literature of Italy and France; but while Chaucer reflects the
spontaneous medieval hostility to the self-seeking and fraudulent
clergy, and writes of deity with quite medieval irreverence,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e19909src" href="#xd25e19909" name=

though it is impossible to found on such passages a confident assertion
that Chaucer had no belief in immortality, it is equally impossible in
view of them to claim that he was a warm believer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Prof. Lounsbury, who has gone closely and critically
into the whole question of Chaucer&rsquo;s religious opinions, asks
concerning the lines in the <i>Knight&rsquo;s Tale</i> on the passing
of Arcite: &ldquo;Can modern agnosticism point to a denial more
emphatic than that made in the fourteenth century of the belief that
there exists for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347"
name="pb347">347</a>]</span>us any assurance of the life that is lived
beyond the grave?&rdquo; (<i>Studies in Chaucer</i>, 1892, ii,
514&ndash;15). Prof. Skeat, again, affirms (Notes to the <i>Tales</i>,
Clar. Press Compl. Chaucer, v, 92) that &ldquo;the <i>real</i> reason
why Chaucer could not here describe the passage of Arcite&rsquo;s soul
to heaven is because he had already copied Boccaccio&rsquo;s
description, and had used it with respect to the death of
Troilus&rdquo; (see <i>Troil.</i> v, 1807&ndash;27; stanzas 7, 8, 9
from the end). This evades the question as to the poet&rsquo;s faith.
In point of fact, the passage in <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i> is purely
pagan, and tells of no Christian belief, though that poem, written
before the <i>Tales</i>, seems to parade a Christian contempt for pagan
lore. (Cp. Lounsbury, as cited, p. 512.)</p>
<p>The ascription of unbelief seems a straining of the evidence; but it
would be difficult to gainsay the critic&rsquo;s summing-up: &ldquo;The
general view of all his [Chaucer&rsquo;s] production leaves upon the
mind the impression that his personal religious history was marked by
the dwindling devoutness which makes up the experience of so many
lives&mdash;the fallings from us, the vanishings, we know not how or
when, of beliefs in which we have been bred. One characteristic which
not unusually accompanies the decline of faith in the individual is in
him very conspicuous. This is the prominence given to the falsity and
fraud of those who have professedly devoted themselves to the
advancement of the cause of Christianity&#8202;&hellip;. Much of
Chaucer&rsquo;s late work, so far as we know it to be late, is
distinctly hostile to the Church&#8202;&hellip;. It is, moreover,
hostile in a way that implies an utter disbelief in certain of its
tenets, and even a disposition to regard them as full of menace to the
future of civilization&rdquo; (Lounsbury, vol. cited, pp.
519&ndash;20).</p>
<p>Against this general view is to be set that which proceeds on an
unquestioning acceptance of the &ldquo;Retractation&rdquo; or
confession at the close of the Canterbury Tales, as to the vexed
question of the genuineness of which see the same critic, work cited,
i, 412&ndash;15; iii, 40. The fact that the document is appended to the
concluding &ldquo;Parson&rsquo;s Tale&rdquo; (also challenged as to
authenticity), which is not a tale at all, and to which the confession
refers as &ldquo;this little treatise or rede,&rdquo; suggests strongly
a clerical influence brought to bear upon the aging poet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To infer real devotion on his part from his sympathetic account of
the good parson, or from the dubious Retractation appended to the
Tales, is as unwarrantable as is the notion, dating from the
Reformation period, that he was a Wicliffite.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e19972src" href="#xd25e19972" name="xd25e19972src">412</a> Even if
the Retractation be of his writing, under pressure in old age, it
points to a previous indifferentism; and from the great mass of his
work <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>there can be drawn only the inference that he is
essentially non-religious in temper and habit of mind. But he is no
disputant, no propagandist, whether on ecclesiastical or on
intellectual grounds; and after his day there is social retrogression
and literary relapse in England for two centuries. That there was some
practical rationalism in his day, however, we gather from the <i>Vision
of Piers Ploughman</i>, by the contemporary poet Langland (fl.
1360&ndash;90), where there is a vivid account of the habit among
anti-clerical laymen of arguing against the doctrine of original sin
and the entailment of Adam&rsquo;s offence on the whole human
race.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e19986src" href="#xd25e19986" name=
"xd25e19986src">413</a> To this way of thinking Chaucer probably gave a
stimulus by his translation of the <i lang="la">De Consolatione
Philosophiae</i> of Boethius, where is cited the &ldquo;not
unskilful&rdquo; dilemma: &ldquo;If God is, whence come wicked things?
And if God is not, whence come good things?&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e19998src" href="#xd25e19998" name="xd25e19998src">414</a> The
stress of the problem is hard upon theism; and to ponder it was to
resent the doctrine of inherited guilt. The Church had, in fact,
visibly turned this dogma to its own ends, insisting on the universal
need of ghostly help even as it repelled the doctrine of unalterable
predestination. In both cases, of course, the matter was settled by
Scripture and authority; and Langland&rsquo;s reply to the heretics is
mere angry dogmatism.</p>
<p>There flourished, further, a remarkable amount of heresy of the
species seen in Provence and Northern Italy in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, such sectaries being known in England under the generic name
of &ldquo;Lollards,&rdquo; derived from the Flemish, in which it seems
to have signified singers of hymns.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20009src" href="#xd25e20009" name="xd25e20009src">415</a>
Lollards or &ldquo;Beghards,&rdquo; starting from the southern point of
propagation, spread all over civilized Northern Europe, meeting
everywhere persecution alike from the parish priests and the mendicant
monks; and in England as elsewhere their anti-clericalism and their
heresy were correlative. In the formal Lollard petition to Parliament
in 1395, however, there is evident an amount of innovating opinion
which implies more than the mere stimulus of financial pressure. Not
only the papal authority, monasteries, clerical celibacy, nuns&rsquo;
vows, transubstantiation, exorcisms, bought blessings, pilgrimages,
prayers for the dead, offerings to images, confessions and absolutions,
but war and capital punishment and &ldquo;unnecessary trades,&rdquo;
such as those of goldsmiths and armourers, are condemned by those early
Utopists.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20018src" href="#xd25e20018" name=
"xd25e20018src">416</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href=
"#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>In what proportion they really
thought out the issues they dealt with we can hardly ascertain; but a
chronicler of Wiclif&rsquo;s time, living at Leicester, testifies that
you could not meet two men in the street but one was a
Lollard.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20029src" href="#xd25e20029" name=
"xd25e20029src">417</a> The movement substantially came to nothing,
suffering murderous persecution in the person of Oldcastle (Lord
Cobham) and others, and disappearing in the fifteenth century in the
demoralization of conquest and the ruin of the civil wars; but apart
from Chaucer&rsquo;s poetry it is more significant of foreign
influences in England than almost any other phenomenon down to the
reign of Henry VIII.</p>
<p>It is still doubtful, indeed, whence the powerful Wiclif derived his
marked Protestantism as to some Catholic dogmas; but it would seem that
he too may have been reached by the older Paulician or other southern
heresy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20037src" href="#xd25e20037" name=
"xd25e20037src">418</a> As early as 1286 a form of heresy approaching
the Albigensian and the Waldensian is found in the province of
Canterbury, certain persons there maintaining that Christians were not
bound by the authority of the Pope and the Fathers, but solely by that
of the Bible and &ldquo;necessary reason.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20046src" href="#xd25e20046" name="xd25e20046src">419</a> It is
true that Wiclif never refers to the Waldenses or Albigenses, or any of
the continental reformers of his day, though he often cites his English
predecessor, Bishop Grosst&ecirc;te;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20052src" href="#xd25e20052" name="xd25e20052src">420</a> but
this may have been on grounds of policy. To cite heretics could do no
good; to cite a bishop was helpful. The main reason for doubting a
foreign influence in his case is that to the last he held by purgatory
and absolute predestination.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20058src" href=
"#xd25e20058" name="xd25e20058src">421</a> In any case, Wiclif&rsquo;s
practical and moral resentment of ecclesiastical abuses was the
mainspring of his doctrine; and his heresies as to transubstantiation
and other articles of faith can be seen to connect with his
anti-priestly attitude. He, however, was morally disinterested as
compared with the would-be plunderers who formed the bulk of the
anti-Church party of John of Gaunt; and his failure to effect any
reformation was due to the fact that on one hand there was not
intelligence enough in the nation to respond to his doctrinal common
sense, while on the other he could not so separate ecclesiastical from
feudal tyranny and extortion as to set up a political movement which
should strike at clerical evils without inciting some to impeach the
nobility who held the balance of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350"
href="#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>political power. Charged with
setting vassals against tyrant lords, he was forced to plead that he
taught the reverse, though he justified the withholding of tithes from
bad curates.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20067src" href="#xd25e20067"

was in no way promoted by Wiclif,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20076src"

people suffered as much from lay as from clerical oppression.</p>
<p>The time, in short, was one of common ferment, and not only were
there other reformers who went much farther than Wiclif in the matter
of social reconstruction,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20085src" href=
"#xd25e20085" name="xd25e20085src">424</a> but we know from his
writings that there were heretics who carried their criticism as far as
to challenge the authority and credibility of the Scriptures. Against
these <i lang="la">accusatores</i> and <i lang="la">inimici
Scripturae</i> he repeatedly speaks in his treatise <i lang="la">De
veritate Scripturae Sacrae</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20100src"
href="#xd25e20100" name="xd25e20100src">425</a> which is thus one of
the very earliest works in defence of Christianity against modern
criticism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20107src" href="#xd25e20107"
name="xd25e20107src">426</a> His position, however, is almost wholly
medieval. One qualification should perhaps be made, in respect of his
occasional resort to reason where it was least to be expected, as on
the question of restrictions on marriage.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20113src" href="#xd25e20113" name="xd25e20113src">427</a> But on
such points he wavered; and otherwise he is merely scripturalist. The
infinite superiority of Christ to all other men, and Christ&rsquo;s
virtual authorship of the entire Scriptures, are his premisses&mdash;a
way of begging the question so simple-minded that it is clear the other
side was not heard in reply, though these arguments had formed part of
his theological lectures,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20119src" href=
"#xd25e20119" name="xd25e20119src">428</a> and so pre-supposed a real
opposition. Wiclif was in short a typical Protestant in his
unquestioning acceptance of the Bible as a supernatural authority; and
when his demand for the publication of the Bible in English was met by
&ldquo;worldly clerks&rdquo; with the cry that it would &ldquo;set
Christians in debate, and subjects to rebel against their
sovereigns,&rdquo; he could only protest that they &ldquo;openly
slander God, the author of peace, and his holy law.&rdquo; Later
English history proved that the worldly clerks were perfectly right,
and Wiclif the erring optimist of faith. For the rest, his essentially
dogmatic view of religion did nothing to counteract the spirit of
persecution; and the passing of the Statute for the Burning of Heretics
in 1401, with the ready consent of both <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

constituted the due dogmatic answer to dogmatic criticism. Yet within a

<h3 class="main">&sect; 11. <i>Thought in France</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As regards France, the record of intellectual history
between the thirteenth and the sixteenth centuries is hardly less
scanty than as regards England. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
the intellectual life of the French philosophic schools, as we saw, was
more vigorous and expansive than that of any other country; so that,
looking further to the Proven&ccedil;al literature and to the French
beginnings of Gothic architecture, France might even be said to prepare
the Renaissance.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20137src" href=
"#xd25e20137" name="xd25e20137src">430</a> Outside of the schools, too,
there was in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries a notable
dissemination of partially philosophical thought among the middle-class
laity. At that period the anti-clerical tendency was strongest in
France, where in the thirteenth century lay scholarship stood highest.
In the reign of Philippe le Bel (end of thirteenth century) was
composed the poem <i>Fauvel</i>, by Fran&ccedil;ois de Rues, which is a
direct attack on pope and clergy;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20146src"
href="#xd25e20146" name="xd25e20146src">431</a> and in the famous
<i lang="fr">Roman de la Rose</i>, as developed by Jean le Clopinel (=
the Limper) of Meung-sur-Loire, there enters, without any criticism of
the Christian creed, an element of all-round Naturalism which
indirectly must have made for reason. Begun by Guillaume de Lorris in
the time of St. Louis in a key of sentiment and lyricism, the poem is
carried on by Jean de Meung under Philippe le Bel in a spirit of
criticism, cynicism, science, and satire, which tells of many
developments in forty years. The continuation can hardly have been
written, as some literary historians assume, about its author&rsquo;s
twenty-fifth year; but it may be dated with some certainty between 1270
and 1285. To the work of his predecessor, amounting to less than 5,000
lines, he added 18,000, pouring forth a medley of scholarship,
pedantry, philosophic reflection, speculation on the process of nature
and the structure and ills of society, on property, morals, marriage,
witchcraft, the characters of women, monks, friars,
aristocrats&mdash;the whole pageant of medieval knowledge and fancy.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span></p>
<p>The literary power of the whole is great, and may be recommended to
the general reader as comparing often with that shown in the satirical
and social-didactic poems of Burns, though without much of the breath
of poetry. Particularly noteworthy, in the historic retrospect, is the
assimilization of the ancient Stoic philosophy of &ldquo;living
according to Nature,&rdquo; set forth in the name of a
&ldquo;Reason&rdquo; who is notably free from theological
prepossessions. It is from this standpoint that Jean de Meung assails
the mendicant friars and the monks in general: he would have men
recognize the natural laws of life; and he carries the principle to the
length of insisting on the artificial nature of aristocracy and
monarchy, which are justifiable only as far as they subserve the common
good. Thus he rises above the medieval literary prejudice against the
common people, whose merit he recognizes as Montaigne did later. On the
side of science, he expressly denies<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20158src" href="#xd25e20158" name="xd25e20158src">432</a> that
comets carry any such message as was commonly ascribed to them alike by
popular superstition and by theology&mdash;a stretch of freethinking
perhaps traceable to Seneca, but nonetheless centuries in advance of
the Christendom of the time.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20161src" href=
"#xd25e20161" name="xd25e20161src">433</a> On the side of religion,
again, he is one of the first to vindicate the lay conception of
Christian excellence as against the ecclesiastical. His Naturalism, so
far, worked consistently in making him at once anti-ascetic and
anti-supernaturalist.</p>
<p>It is not to be inferred, however, that Jean de Meung had learned to
doubt the validity of the Christian creed. His long poem, one of the
most popular books in Europe for two hundred years, could never have
had its vogue if its readers could have suspected it to be even
indirectly anti-Christian. He can hardly have held, as some historians
believe,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20166src" href="#xd25e20166" name=
"xd25e20166src">434</a> the status of a preaching friar; but he claims
that he neither blames nor defames religion,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20169src" href="#xd25e20169" name="xd25e20169src">435</a>
respecting it in all forms, provided it be &ldquo;humble and
loyal.&rdquo; He was in fact a man of some wealth, much culture, and
orderly in life, thus standing out from the earlier
&ldquo;Goliard&rdquo; type. When, then, he pronounces Nature &ldquo;the
minister of this earthly state,&rdquo; &ldquo;vicar and constable of
the eternal emperor,&rdquo; he has no thought of dethroning Deity, or
even of setting aside the Christian faith. In his rhymed
<i>Testament</i> he expresses himself quite piously, and lectures monks
and women in an edifying fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">To say therefore that Jean de Meung&rsquo;s part of
the <i lang="fr">Roman de la Rose</i> is a &ldquo;popular satire on the
beliefs of Romanism&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href=
"#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>(Owen, <i>Skeptics of Ital.
Renais.</i> p. 44) is to misstate the case. His doctrine is rather an
intellectual expression of the literary reaction against asceticism
(cp. Bartoli, <i lang="it">Storia della letteratura italiana</i>, i,
319, quoting Lenient) which had been spontaneously begun by the
Goliards and Troubadours. At the same time the poem does stand for the
new secular spirit alike in &ldquo;its ingrained religion and its
nascent freethought&rdquo; (Saintsbury, p. 87); and with the
<i>Reynard</i> epic it may be taken as representing the beginning of
&ldquo;a whole revolution, the resurgence and affirmation of the laity,
the new force which is to transform the world, against the
Church&rdquo; (Bartoli, <i lang="it">Storia</i>, i, 308; cp. Demogeot,
<i lang="fr">Hist. de la litt. fr.</i> 5e &eacute;d. pp. 130&ndash;31,
157; Lanson, pp. 132&ndash;36). The frequent flings at the clergy (cp.
the partly Chaucerian English version, Skeat&rsquo;s ed. of
Chaucer&rsquo;s Works, i, 234; Bell&rsquo;s ed. iv, 230) were
sufficient to draw upon this as upon other medieval poems of much
secular vogue the anger of &ldquo;the Church&rdquo; (Sismondi, <i>Lit.
of South. Europe</i>, i, 216); but they were none the less relished by
believing readers. &ldquo;The Church&rdquo; was in fact not an entity
of one mind; and some of its sections enjoyed satire directed against
the others.</p>
<p>When, then, we speak of the anti-clerical character of much medieval
poetry, we must guard against exaggerated implications. It is somewhat
of a straining of the facts, for instance, to say of the humorous tale
of <i>Reynard the Fox</i>, so widely popular in the thirteenth century,
that it is essentially anti-clerical to the extent that &ldquo;Reynard
is laic: Isengrim [the wolf] is clerical&rdquo; (Bartoli, <i lang=
"it">Storia della letteratura italiana</i>, i, 307; cp. Owen,
<i>Skeptics of the Italian Renaissance</i>, p. 44). The <i>Reynard</i>
epic, in origin a simple humorous animal-story, had various later
forms. Some of these, as the Latin poem, and especially the version
attributed to Peter of St. Cloud, were markedly anti-clerical, the
latter exhibiting a spirit of all-round profanity hardly compatible
with belief (cp. Gervinus, <i lang="de">Geschichte der deutschen
Dichtung</i>, 5te Ausg. i, 227&ndash;28; Gebhart, <i lang="fr">Les
Origines de la Renais. en Italie</i>, 1874, p. 39); but the version
current in the Netherlands, which was later rendered into English prose
by Caxton, is of a very different character (Gervinus, p. 229
<i>sq.</i>). In Caxton&rsquo;s version it is impossible to regard
Reynard as laic and Isengrim as clerical; though in the Latin and other
versions the wolf figures as monk or abbot. (See also the various
shorter satires published by Grimm in his <i lang="de">Reinhart
Fuchs</i>, 1834.) Often the authorship is itself clerical, one party or
order satirizing another; sometimes the spirit is religious, sometimes
markedly irreverent. (Gervinus, pp. 214&ndash;21). &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">La plupart de ces satires sont l&rsquo;&oelig;uvre des moines et
des abb&eacute;s</span>&rdquo; (Lenient, <i lang="fr">La Satire en
France au moyen &acirc;ge</i>, 1859, pr&eacute;f. p. 4); and to say
that these men were often irreligious is not to say that they were
rationalists. It is to be remembered that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>nascent Protestantism
in England under Henry VIII resorted to the weapons of obscene parody
(Blunt, <i>Ref. of Ch. of England</i>, ed. 1892, i, 273,
<i>note</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In fine,&rdquo; we may say with a judicious French historian,
&ldquo;one cannot get out of his time, and the time was not come to be
non-Christian. Jean de Meung did not perceive that his thought put him
outside the Church, and upset her foundations. He is believing and
pious, like Rutebeuf&#8202;&hellip;. The Gospel is his rule: he holds
it; he defends it; he disputes with those who seem to him to depart
from it; he makes himself the champion of the old faith against the
novelties of the <i>Eternal Gospel</i>&hellip;. His situation is that
of the first reformers of the sixteenth century, who believed
themselves to serve Jesus Christ in using their reason, and who very
sincerely, very piously, hoped for the reform of the Church through the
progress of philosophy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20250src"
href="#xd25e20250" name="xd25e20250src">436</a>
&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; adds the same historian, &ldquo;one cannot
exaggerate the real weight of the work. By his philosophy, which
consists essentially in the identity, the sovereignty, of Nature and
Reason, he is the first link in the chain which connects Rabelais,
Montaigne, Moli&egrave;re; to which Voltaire also links himself, and
even in certain regards Boileau.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20256src" href="#xd25e20256" name="xd25e20256src">437</a></p>
<p>Men could not then see whither the principle of &ldquo;Nature&rdquo;
and Reason was to lead, yet even in the age of Jean de Meung the
philosophic heads went far, and he can hardly have missed knowing as
much, if, as is supposed, he studied at Paris, as he certainly lived
and died there. In the latter part of the thirteenth century, as before
noted, rationalism at the Paris university was frequently carried in
private to a rejection of all the dogmas peculiar to Christianity. At
that great school Roger Bacon seems to have acquired his
encyclop&aelig;dic learning and his critical habit; and there it was
that in the first half of the fourteenth century William of Occam
nourished his remarkable philosophic faculty. From about the middle of
the fourteenth century, however, there is a relative arrest of French
progress for some two centuries.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20263src"
href="#xd25e20263" name="xd25e20263src">438</a> Three main conditions
served to check intellectual advance: the civil wars which involved the
loss of the communal liberties which had been established in France
between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20278src" href="#xd25e20278" name="xd25e20278src">439</a> the
exhaustion of the nation by the English invasion under Edward III; the
repressive power of the Church; and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb355" href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>general devotion of
the national energies to war. After the partial recovery from the
ruinous English invasion under Edward III, civil strifes and feudal
tyranny wrought new impoverishment, making possible the still more
destructive invasion under Henry V; so that in the first half of the
fifteenth century France was hardly more civilized than
England.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20291src" href="#xd25e20291" name=
"xd25e20291src">440</a> It is from the French invasion of Italy under
Charles VIII that the enduring renascence in France broadly dates.
Earlier impulses had likewise come from Italy: Lanfranc, Anselm, Peter
Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, and others of lesser note,<a class="noteref"

gone from Italy to teach in France or England; but it needed the full
contact of Italian civilization to raise monarchic France to the stage
of general and independent intellectual life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">During the period in question, there had been
established the following universities: Paris, 1200; Toulouse, 1220;
Montpellier, 1289; Avignon, 1303; Orl&eacute;ans, 1312; Cahors, 1332;
Angers, 1337; Orange, 1367; D&ocirc;le, 1422; Poitiers, 1431; Caen,
1436; Valence, 1454; Nantes, 1460; Bourges, 1463; Bordeaux, 1472
(Desmaze, <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Universit&eacute; de Paris</i>, 1876, p.
2. Other dates for some of these are given on p. 31). But the
militarist conditions prevented any sufficient development of such
opportunities. In the fourteenth century, says Littr&eacute; (<i lang=
"fr">&Eacute;tudes sur les barbares</i>, p. 419), &ldquo;the university
of Paris &hellip; was more powerful than at any other
epoch&#8202;&hellip;. Never did she exercise such a power over
men&rsquo;s minds.&rdquo; But he also decides that in that epoch the
first florescence of French literature withered away (p. 387). The long
location of the anti-papacy at Avignon (1305&ndash;1376) doubtless
counted for something in French culture (V. Le Clerc, <i lang=
"fr">Hist. Litt. de la France au XIVe si&egrave;cle</i>, i, 37;
Gebhart, pp. 221&ndash;26); but the devastation wrought by the English
invasion was sufficient to countervail that and more. See the account
of it by Petrarch (letter of the year 1360) cited by Littr&eacute;,
<i lang="fr">&Eacute;tudes</i>, pp. 416&ndash;17; and by Hallam,
<i>Middle Ages</i>, i, 59, <i>note</i>. Cp. Michelet, <i lang=

Fifteenth Century</i>, 1888, pp. 79&ndash;84. As to the consequences of

</blockquote>
<p>In northern France of the fourteenth century, as in Provence and
Italy and England, there was a manifold stir of innovation and heresy:
there as elsewhere the insubordinate Franciscans, with their <i>Eternal
Gospel</i>, the Paterini, the Beghards, fought their way against
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>the Dominican Inquisition. But the Inquisitors
burned books as well as men; and much anti-ecclesiastical poetry, some
dating even from the Carlovingian era, shared the fate of many copies
of the Talmud, translations of the Bible, and, &agrave; fortiori, every
species of heretical writing. In effect, the Inquisition for the time
&ldquo;extinguished freethought&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20354src" href="#xd25e20354" name="xd25e20354src">442</a> in
France. As in England, the ferment of heresy was mixed with one of
democracy; and in the French popular poetry of the time there are
direct parallels to the contemporary English couplet, &ldquo;When Adam
delved and Eve span, Where was then the gentleman?&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e20360src" href="#xd25e20360" name=
"xd25e20360src">443</a> Such a spirit could no more prosper in feudal
France than in feudal England; and when France emerged from her mortal
struggle with the English, to be effectively solidified by Louis XI,
there was left in her life little of the spirit of free inquiry. It has
been noted that whereas the chronicler Joinville, in the thirteenth
century, is full of religious feeling, Froissart, in the fourteenth,
priest as he is, exhibits hardly any; and again Comines, in the
fifteenth, reverts to the orthodoxy of the twelfth and
thirteenth.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20363src" href="#xd25e20363"
name="xd25e20363src">444</a> The middle period was one of indifference,
following on the killing out of heresy:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20370src" href="#xd25e20370" name="xd25e20370src">445</a> the
fifteenth century is a resumption of the Middle Ages, and Comines has
the medieval cast of mind,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20376src" href=

order. There seems to be no community of thought between him and his
younger Italian contemporaries, Machiavelli and Guicciardini; though,
&ldquo;even while Comines was writing, there were unequivocal symptoms
of a great and decisive change.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20382src" href="#xd25e20382" name="xd25e20382src">447</a></p>
<p>The special development in France of the spirit of
&ldquo;chivalry&rdquo; had joined the normal uncivilizing influence of
militarism with that of clericalism; the various knightly orders, as
well as knighthood pure and simple, being all under ecclesiastical
sanctions, and more or less strictly vowed to &ldquo;defend the
church,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20387src" href="#xd25e20387"
name="xd25e20387src">448</a> while supremely incompetent to form an
intelligent opinion. It is the more remarkable that in the case of one
of the crusading orders heresy of the most blasphemous kind was finally
charged against the entire organization, and that it was on that ground
annihilated (1311). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357"
name="pb357">357</a>]</span>It remains incredible, however, that the
order of the Templars can have systematically practised the
extravagances or held the tenets laid to their charge. They had of
course abused their power and departed from their principles like every
other religious order enabled to amass wealth; and the hostility theirs
aroused is perfectly intelligible from what is known of the arrogance
of its members and the general ruffianism of the Crusaders. Their
wealth alone goes far to explain the success of their enemies against
them; for, though the numbers of the order were much smaller than
tradition gives out, its possessions were considerable. These were the
true ground of the French king&rsquo;s attack.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20398src" href="#xd25e20398" name="xd25e20398src">449</a> But
that its members were as a rule either Cathari or anti-Christians,
either disguised Moslems or deists, or that they practised obscenity by
rule, there is no reason to believe. What seems to have happened was a
resort by some unbelieving members to more or less gross burlesque of
the mysteries of initiation&mdash;a phenomenon paralleled in ancient
Greece and in the modern Catholic world, and implying rather hardy
irreligion than any reasoned heresy whatever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The long-continued dispute as to the guilt of the
Knights Templars is still chronically re-opened. Hallam, after long
hesitation, came finally to believe them guilty, partly on the strength
of the admissions made by Michelet in defending them (<i>Europe in the
Middle Ages</i>, 11th ed. i<span class="corr" id="xd25e20422" title=
"Source: .">,</span> 138&ndash;42&mdash;<i>note</i> of 1848). He
attaches, however, a surprising weight to the obviously weak
&ldquo;architectural evidence&rdquo; cited by Hammer-Purgstall. Heeren
(<i lang="fr">Essai sur l&rsquo;influence des croisades</i>, 1808, pp.
221&ndash;22) takes a more judicial view. The excellent summing-up of
Lea (<i>Hist. of the Inquis.</i> bk. iii, ch. v, pp. 263&ndash;76)
perhaps gives too little weight to the mass of curious confirmatory
evidence cited by writers on the other side (<i>e.g.</i>, F. Nicolai,
<i lang="de">Versuch &uuml;ber die Beschuldigungen welche dem
Tempelherrenorden gemacht worden</i>, 1782); but his conclusion as to
the falsity of the charges against the order as a whole seems
irresistible.</p>
<p>The solution that offensive practices occurred irregularly (Lea, pp.
276&ndash;77) is pointed to even by the earlier hostile writers
(Nicolai, p. 17). It seems to be certain that the initiatory rites
included the act of spitting on the crucifix&mdash;presumptively a
symbolic display of absolute obedience to the orders of those in
command (Jolly, <i lang="fr">Philippe le Bel</i>, pp. 264&ndash;68).
That there was no Catharism in the order seems certain (Lea, p. 249).
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span>suggestion that the offensive and burlesque
practices were due to the lower grade of &ldquo;serving
brethren,&rdquo; who were contemned by the higher, seems, however,
without firm foundation. The courage for such freaks, and the
disposition to commit them, were rather more likely to arise among the
crusaders of the upper class, who could come in contact with
Moslem-Christian unbelief through those of Sicily.</p>
<p>For the further theory that the &ldquo;Freemasons&rdquo; (at that
period really cosmopolitan guilds of masons) were already given to
freethinking, there is again no evidence. That they at times
deliberately introduced obscene symbols into church architecture is no
proof that they were collectively unbelievers in the Church&rsquo;s
doctrines; though it is likely enough that some of them were. Obscenity
is the expression not of an intellectual but of a physical and
unreasoning bias, and can perfectly well concur with religious feeling.
The fact that the medieval masons did not confine obscene symbols to
the churches they built for the Templars (Hallam, as cited, pp.
140&ndash;41) should serve to discredit alike the theory that the
Templars were systematically anti-Christian, and the theory that the
Freemasons were so. That for centuries the builders of the Christian
churches throughout Europe formed an anti-Christian organization is a
grotesque hypothesis. At most they indulged in freaks of artistic
satire on the lines of contemporary satirical literature, expressing an
anti-clerical bias, with perhaps occasional elements of blasphemy. (See
Menzel, <i lang="de">Gesch. der Deutschen</i>, Cap. 252, <i>note</i>.)
It could well be that there survived among the Freemasons various
Gnostic ideas; since the architectural art itself came in a direct line
from antiquity. Such heresy, too, might conceivably be winked at by the
Church, which depended so much on the heretics&rsquo; services. But
their obscenities were the mere expression of the animal imagination
and normal salacity of all ages. Only in modern times, and that only in
Catholic countries, has the derivative organization of Freemasonry been
identified with freethought propaganda. In England in the seventeenth
century the Freemasonic clubs&mdash;no longer connected with any
trade&mdash;were thoroughly royalist and orthodox (Nicolai, pp.
196&ndash;98), as they have always remained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some remarkable intellectual phenomena, however, do connect with the
French university life of the first half of the fourteenth century.
<span class="sc">William of Occam</span> (d. 1347), the English
Franciscan, who taught at Paris, is on the whole the most rationalistic
of medieval philosophers. Though a pupil of the Realist Duns Scotus, he
became the renewer of Nominalism, which is the specifically
rationalistic as opposed to the religious mode of metaphysic; and his
anti-clerical bias was such that he had to fly from France to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>Bavaria for protection from the priesthood. His
<i lang="la">Disputatio super potestate ecclesiastica</i>, and his
<i lang="la">Defensorium</i> directed against Pope John XXII (or XXI),
were so uncompromising that in 1323 the Pope gave directions for his
prosecution. What came of the step is not known; but in 1328 we find
him actually imprisoned with two Italian comrades in the papal palace
at Avignon. Thence they made their escape to Bavaria.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e20470src" href="#xd25e20470" name="xd25e20470src">450</a> To
the same refuge fled Marsiglio of Padua, author (with John of Jandun)
of the <i lang="la">Defensor Pacis</i> (1324), &ldquo;the greatest and
most original political treatise of the Middle Ages,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e20480src" href="#xd25e20480" name=
"xd25e20480src">451</a> in which it is taught that, though monarchy may
be expedient, the sovereignty of the State rests with the people, and
the hereditary principle is flatly rejected; while it is insisted that
the Church properly consists of all Christians, and that the
clergy&rsquo;s authority is restricted to spiritual affairs and moral
suasion.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20495src" href="#xd25e20495" name=
"xd25e20495src">452</a> Of all medieval writers on politics before
Machiavelli he is the most modern.</p>
<p>Only less original is Occam, who at Paris came much under
Marsiglio&rsquo;s influence. His philosophic doctrines apparently
derive from <span class="sc">Pierre Aureol</span> (Petrus Aureolus, d.
1321), who with remarkable clearness and emphasis rejected both Realism
and the doctrine that what the mind perceives are not realities, but
<i lang="la">form&aelig; speculares</i>. Pierre it was who first
enounced the Law of Parsimony in philosophy and science&mdash;that
causes are not to be multiplied beyond mental necessity&mdash;which is
specially associated with the name of Occam.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20509src" href="#xd25e20509" name="xd25e20509src">453</a> Both
anticipated modern criticism<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20512src" href=
"#xd25e20512" name="xd25e20512src">454</a> alike of the Platonic and
the Aristotelian philosophy; and Occam in particular drew so decided a
line between the province of reason and that of faith that there can be
little doubt on which side his allegiance lay.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20518src" href="#xd25e20518" name="xd25e20518src">455</a> His
dialectic is for its time as remarkable as is that of Hume, four
centuries later. The most eminent orthodox thinker of the preceding
century had been the Franciscan John Duns Scotus (1265 or
1274&ndash;1308), who, after teaching great crowds of students at
Oxford, was transferred in 1304 to Paris, and in 1308 to Cologne, where
he died. A Realist in his philosophy, Duns Scotus opposed the
Aristotelian scholasticism, and in particular criticized Thomas Aquinas
as having unduly subordinated faith and practice to speculation and
theory. The number of matters of faith which Thomas had held to be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>demonstrable by reason, accordingly, was by Duns
Scotus much reduced; and, applying his anti-rationalism to current
belief, he fought zealously for the dogma that Mary, like Jesus, was
immaculately conceived.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20524src" href=
"#xd25e20524" name="xd25e20524src">456</a> But Occam, turning his
predecessor&rsquo;s tactic to a contrary purpose, denied that any
matter of faith was demonstrable by reason at all. He granted that on
rational grounds the existence of a God was probable, but denied that
it was strictly demonstrable, and rejected the ontological argument of
Anselm. As to matters of faith, he significantly observed that the will
to believe the indemonstrable is meritorious.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20533src" href="#xd25e20533" name="xd25e20533src">457</a></p>
<p>It is difficult now to recover a living sense of the issues at stake
in the battle between Nominalism and Realism, and of the social
atmosphere in which the battle was carried on. Broadly speaking, the
Nominalists were the more enlightened school, the Realists standing for
tradition and authority; and it has been alleged that &ldquo;the books
of the Nominalists, though the art of printing tended strongly to
preserve them, were suppressed and destroyed to such a degree that it
is now exceedingly difficult to collect them, and not easy to obtain
copies even of the most remarkable.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20541src" href="#xd25e20541" name="xd25e20541src">458</a> On the
other hand, while we have seen Occam a fugitive before clerical enmity,
we shall see Nominalists agreeing to persecute a Realist to the death
in the person of Huss in the following century. So little was there to
choose between the camps in the matter of sound civics; and so easily
could the hierarchy wear the colours of any philosophical system.</p>
<p>Contemporary with Occam was Durand de St. Pour&ccedil;ain, who
became a bishop (d. 1332), and, after ranking as of the school of
Thomas Aquinas, rejected and opposed its doctrine. With all this heresy
in the air, the principle of &ldquo;double truth,&rdquo; originally put
in currency by Averro&iuml;sm, came to be held in France as in Italy,
in a sense which implied the consciousness that theological truth is
not truth at all.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20550src" href=
"#xd25e20550" name="xd25e20550src">459</a> Occam&rsquo;s pupil,
Buridan, rector of the University of Paris (fl. 1340), substantially
avoided theology, and dealt with moral and intellectual problems on
their own merits.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20553src" href=
"#xd25e20553" name="xd25e20553src">460</a> It is recorded by Albert of

had at Paris an unbroken line of successors down to the
Reformation.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20568src" href="#xd25e20568"
name="xd25e20568src">463</a> In a world in which the doctrine of a
two-fold truth provided a safety-valve for heresy, such a philosophical
doctrine as his could not greatly affect lay thought; but at Paris
University in the year 1376 there was a startling display of
freethinking by the philosophical students, not a little suggestive of
a parody of the Averro&iuml;st propositions denounced by the Bishop of
Paris exactly a century before. Under cover of the doctrine of two-fold
truth they propounded a list of 219 theses, in which they (1) denied
the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, the resurrection, and the
immortality of the soul; (2) affirmed the eternity of matter and the
uselessness of prayer, but also posited the principles of astrology;
(3) argued that the higher powers of the soul are incapable of sin, and
that voluntary sexual intercourse between the unmarried is not sinful;
and (4) suggested that there are fables and falsehoods in the gospels
as in other books.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20571src" href=
"#xd25e20571" name="xd25e20571src">464</a> The element of youthful
gasconnade in the performance is obvious, and the Archbishop sharply
scolded the students; but there must have been much free discussion
before such a manifesto could have been produced. Nevertheless,
untoward political conditions prevented any dissemination of the
freethinking spirit in France; and not for some two centuries was there
such another growth of it. The remarkable case of Nicolaus of
Autricuria, who in 1348 was forced to recant his teaching of the
atomistic doctrine,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20580src" href=
"#xd25e20580" name="xd25e20580src">465</a> illustrates at once the
persistence of the spirit of reason in times of darkness, and the
impossibility of its triumphing in the wrong conditions.</p>

<p class="first">The life of the rest of Europe in the later medieval
period has little special significance in the history of freethought.
France and Italy, by German admission, were the lands of the medieval

href="#xd25e20596" name="xd25e20596src">466</a> The poetry of the
German Minnesingers, a growth from that of the Troubadours, presented
the same anti-clerical features;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20602src"
href="#xd25e20602" name="xd25e20602src">467</a> and the story of
<i>Reynard the Fox</i> was turned to anti-ecclesiastical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>purpose in Germany as in France. The relative
freethinking set up by the crusaders&rsquo; contact with the Saracens
seems to be the source of doubt of the Minnesinger Freidank concerning
the doom of hell-fire on heretics and heathens, the opinion of
<span class="sc" lang="de">Walter der Vogelweide</span> that
Christians, Jews, and Moslems all serve the same God,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e20626src" href="#xd25e20626" name="xd25e20626src">468</a> and
still more mordant heresy. But such bold freethinking did not spread.
Material prosperity rather than culture was the main feature of German
progress in the Middle Ages; architecture being the only art greatly
developed. Heresy of the anti-ecclesiastical order indeed abounded, and
was duly persecuted; but the higher freethinking developments were in
the theosophic rather than the rationalistic direction. Albert the
Great (fl. 1260), &ldquo;the universal Doctor,&rdquo; the chief German
teacher of the Middle Ages, was of unimpeached orthodoxy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e20635src" href="#xd25e20635" name=
"xd25e20635src">469</a></p>
<p>The principal German figure of the period is Master Eckhart (d.
1329), who, finding religious beliefs excluded from the sphere of
reason by the freer philosophy of his day, undertook to show that they
were all matters of reason. He was, in fact, a mystically reasoning
preacher, and he taught in the interests of popular religion.
Naturally, as he philosophized on old bases, he did not really subject
his beliefs to any skeptical scrutiny, but took them for granted and
proceeded speculatively upon them. This sufficed to bring him before
the Inquisition at Cologne, where he recanted conditionally on an
appeal to the Pope. Dying soon after, he escaped the papal bull
condemning twenty-eight of his doctrines. His school later divided into
a heretical and a Church party, of which the former, called the
&ldquo;false free spirits,&rdquo; seems to have either joined or
resembled the antinomian Brethren of the Free Spirit, then numerous in
Germany. The other section became known as the &ldquo;Friends of
God,&rdquo; a species of mystics who were &ldquo;faithful to the whole
medieval imaginative creed, Transubstantiation, worship of the Virgin
and Saints, Purgatory.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20648src"
href="#xd25e20648" name="xd25e20648src">470</a> Through Tauler and
others, Eckhart&rsquo;s pietistic doctrine gave a lead to later
Protestant evangelicalism; but the system as a whole can never have
been held by any popular body.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20654src"
href="#xd25e20654" name="xd25e20654src">471</a> <span class=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">Dr. Lasson pronounces (Ueberweg, i, 483) that the type
of Eckhart&rsquo;s character and teaching &ldquo;was derived from the
innermost essence of the German national character.&rdquo; At the same
time he admits that all the offshoots of the school departed more or
less widely from Eckhart&rsquo;s type&mdash;that is, from the innermost
essence of their own national character. It would be as plausible to
say that the later mysticism of F&eacute;nelon derived from the
innermost essence of the French character. The <i lang="la">Imitatio
Christi</i> has been similarly described as expressing the German
character, on the assumption that it was written by Thomas &agrave;
Kempis. Many have held that the author was the Frenchman Gerson
(Hallam, <i>Lit. of Europe</i>, ed. 1872, i, 139&ndash;40). It was in
all probability, as was held by Suarez, the work of several hands, one
a monk of the twelfth century, another a monk of the thirteenth, and
the third a theologian of the fifteenth; neither Gerson nor Thomas
&agrave; Kempis being concerned (Le Clerc, <i lang="fr">Hist. Litt. du
XIVe Si&egrave;cle</i>, 2e &eacute;dit. pp. 384&ndash;85; cp.
Neale&rsquo;s <i>Hist. of the so-called Jansenist Church of
Holland</i>, 1858, pp. 97&ndash;98).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i lang="la">Imitatio Christi</i> (1471), the most popular
Christian work of devotion ever published,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20697src" href="#xd25e20697" name="xd25e20697src">472</a> tells
all the while of the obscure persistence of the search for knowledge
and for rational satisfactions. Whatever be the truth as to its
authorship, it belongs to all Christendom in respect of its querulous
strain of protest against all manner of intellectual curiosity. After
the first note of world-renunciation, the call to absorption in the
inner religious life, there comes the sharp protest against the
&ldquo;desire to know.&rdquo; &ldquo;Surely an humble husbandman that
serveth God is better than a proud philosopher who, neglecting himself,
laboureth to understand the course of the heavens&#8202;&hellip;. Cease
from an inordinate desire of knowing.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20700src" href="#xd25e20700" name="xd25e20700src">473</a> No
sooner is the reader warned to consider himself the frailest of all men
than he is encouraged to look down on all reasoners. &ldquo;What
availeth it to cavil and dispute much about dark and hidden things,
when for being ignorant of them we shall not be so much as reproved at
the day of judgment? It is a great folly to neglect the things that are
profitable and necessary, and give our minds to that which is curious
and hurtful&#8202;&hellip;. And what have we to do with <i lang=
"la">genus</i> and <i lang="la">species</i>, the dry notions of
logicians?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20710src" href=
"#xd25e20710" name="xd25e20710src">474</a> The homily swings to and fro
between occasional admissions that &ldquo;learning is not to be
blamed,&rdquo; perhaps interpolated by one who feared to have religion
figure as opposed to knowledge, and recurrent flings&mdash;perhaps also
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>interpolated&mdash;at all who seek book-lore or
physical science; but the note of distrust of reason prevails.
&ldquo;Where are all those Doctors and Masters whom thou didst well
know whilst they lived and flourished in learning? Now others have
their livings, and perchance scarce ever think of them. While they
lived they seemed something, but now they are not spoken
of.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20715src" href="#xd25e20715"
name="xd25e20715src">475</a> It belongs to the whole conception of
retreat and aloofness that the devout man should &ldquo;meddle not with
curiosities, but read such things as may rather yield compunction to
his heart than occupation to his head&rdquo;; and the last chapter of
the last book closes on the note of the abnegation of reason.
&ldquo;Human reason is feeble and may be deceived, but true faith
cannot be deceived. All reason and natural search ought to follow
faith, not to go before it, nor to break in upon it&#8202;&hellip;. If
the works of God were such that they might be easily comprehended by
human reason, they could not be justly called marvellous or
unspeakable.&rdquo; Thus the very inculcation of humility, by its
constant direction against all intellectual exercise, becomes an
incitement to a spiritual arrogance; and all manner of science finds in
the current ideal of piety its pre-ordained antagonist. <span class=

in reverence (Tozer&rsquo;s note to Finlay, ii, 165; cp. Waddington,

probable that the sheer loss of artistic skill counted for much in the

Neander, <i>Hist. of the Chr. Church</i>, v, 187. See the whole section
for a good account of the general economic and moral evolution. Neander
repeatedly (pp. 186&ndash;87) insists on the &ldquo;magical&rdquo;
element in the doctrine of the mass, as established by Gregory the
Great.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd25e16667src">&uarr;</a></p>

Neander, as cited, v, 183. The point was well put some centuries later
by the Italian story-teller Masuccio, an orthodox Catholic but a
vehement anti-clericalist, in a generalization concerning the monks:
&ldquo;The best punishment for them would be for God to abolish
Purgatory; they would then receive no more alms, and would be forced to
go back to their spades.&rdquo; Cited by Burckhardt, <i>The
Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy</i>, Eng. tr. 1892, p.

Hardwick, p. 306; Kurtz, i, 433. The derivation through the Italian is
however disputed. Cp. Murdock&rsquo;s note to Mosheim, Reid&rsquo;s ed.
p. 385, and Gieseler, ii, 486. The <i>Chazari</i>, a Turkish (Crimean)
people, partly Christian and partly Moslem in the ninth century
(Gieseler, as cited), may have given the name of <i>Gazzari</i>, as
<i>Bulgar</i> gave <i>Bougre</i>; and the German <i>Ketzer</i> may have
come directly from <i>Chazar</i>. The Christianity of the Chazars,
influenced by neighbourhood with Islam, seems to have been a very free
syncretism.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

record that Gerbert, afterwards Pope Sylvester II, studied in Spain
among the Arabs (Ueberweg, i, 369) has of late years been discredited
(Olleris, <i lang="fr">Vie de Gerbert</i>, 1867, chs. ii and xxv;
Ueberweg, p. 430; Poole, <i>Illustrations</i>, p. 88); but its very
currency depended on the commonness of some such proceeding in his age.
In any case, the teaching he would receive at the Spanish monastery of
Borel would owe all its value to Saracen culture. Cp. Abb&eacute;
Queant, <i>Gerbert</i>, pp. 26&ndash;32. The greatness of the service
he rendered to northern Europe in introducing the Arabic numerals is
expressed in the legend of his magical powers. Compare the legends as

Matthew Paris records that in 1249 four hundred and forty-three
heretics were burned in Saxony and Pomerania. Previously multitudes had
been burned by the Inquisitor Conrad, who was himself finally murdered
in revenge. He was the confessor of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary, and he
taught her among other things, &ldquo;Be merciful to your
neighbour,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do to others whatsoever you would that
they should do to you.&rdquo; See his praises recorded by Montalembert,
as cited, vol. i, ch. x. Cp. Gieseler, Per. III, Div. iii, &sect; 89

Poole, p. 175. It is not impossible that, as Sismondi suggests
(<i lang="fr">Histoire des Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, ed. 1823, v,
294&ndash;96), Abailard was persecuted mainly because of the dangerous
anti-papal movement maintained in Italy for fifteen years
(1139&ndash;1155) by his doctrinally orthodox pupil, Arnold of Brescia.
But Hampden (p. 40), agreeing with Guizot (<i lang="fr">Hist. de Civ.

was no sympathy between the efforts of the Italian Republics to obtain

Owen, p. 113. It is to be remembered that Dante also (<i lang=

the word in the old sense of mere mentality&mdash;the thinking as
distinguished from the sensuous element in man; and he was fierce
against all resort to reason as against faith. Petrarch was of course
more of a rationalist. As to his philosophic skepticism, see Owen, p.
120. He drew the line only at doubting those things &ldquo;in which
doubt is sacrilege.&rdquo; Nevertheless he grounded his belief in
immortality not on the Christian creed, but on the arguments of the
pagans (Burckhardt, p. 546).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

There had previously been sharp social persecution by the
Cort&egrave;s, in 1480, on &ldquo;anti-Semitic&rdquo; grounds, the Jews
being then debarred from all the professions, and even from commerce.
They were thus driven to usury by Christians, who latterly denounce the
race for usuriousness. Cp. Michelet, <i lang="fr">Hist. de France</i>,

Brewer, p. xciii, <i>note</i>, cites this in an extract from the
Chronicle of Antoninus, Archbishop of Florence, a late writer of the
fifteenth century, who &ldquo;gives no authority for his
statement.&rdquo; Dr. Bridges, however, was enabled by M. Sabatier to
trace the passage back to the MS. <i lang="la">Chronica xxiv Generalium
Ordinis Minorum</i>, which belongs to the first half of the fourteenth
century; and the passage, as M. Sabatier remarks, has all the
appearance of being an extract from the official journal of this Order.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What is called the Renaissance was, broadly speaking,
an evolution of the culture forces seen at work in the later
&ldquo;Middle Ages,&rdquo; newly fertilized by the recovery of classic
literature; and we shall have to revert at several points of our survey
to what we have been considering as &ldquo;medieval&rdquo; in order to
perceive the &ldquo;new birth.&rdquo; The term is inconveniently vague,
and is made to cover different periods, sometimes extending from the
thirteenth to the sixteenth century, sometimes signifying only the
fifteenth. It seems reasonable to apply it, as regards Italy, to the
period in which southern culture began to outgo that of France, and
kept its lead&mdash;that is, from the end of the fourteenth
century<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20735src" href="#xd25e20735" name=
"xd25e20735src">1</a> to the time of the Counter-Reformation. That is a
comparatively distinct sociological era.</p>
<p>Renascent Italy is, after ancient Greece, the great historical
illustration of the sociological law that the higher civilizations
arise through the passing-on of seeds of culture from older to newer
societies, under conditions that specially foster them and give them
freer growth. The straitened and archaic pictorial art of Byzantium,
unprogressive in the hidebound life of the Eastern Empire, developed in
the free and striving Italian communities till it paralleled the
sculpture of ancient Greece; and it is to be said for the Church that,
however she might stifle rational thought, she economically elicited
the arts of painting and architecture (statuary being tabooed as too
much associated with pagan worships), even as Greek religion had
promoted architecture and sculpture. By force, however, of the tendency
of the arts to keep religion anthropomorphic where deeper culture is
lacking, popular belief in Renaissance Italy was substantially on a par
with that of polytheistic Greece.</p>
<p>Before the general recovery of ancient literature, the main motives
to rationalism, apart from the tendency of the Aristotelian
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>philosophy to set up doubts about creation and
Providence and a future state, were (1) the spectacle of the competing
creed of Islam,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20747src" href="#xd25e20747"
name="xd25e20747src">2</a> made known to the Italians first by
intercourse with the Moors, later by the Crusades; and further and more
fully by the Saracenized culture of Sicily and commercial intercourse
with the east; (2) the spectacle of the strife of creeds within
Christendom;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20764src" href="#xd25e20764"
name="xd25e20764src">3</a> and (3) the spectacle of the worldliness and
moral insincerity of the bulk of the clergy. It is in that atmosphere
that the Renaissance begins; and it may be said that freethought stood
veiled beside its cradle.</p>
<p>In such an atmosphere, even on the ecclesiastical side, demand for
&ldquo;reforms&rdquo; naturally made headway; and the Council of
Constance (1414&ndash;1418) was convened to enact many besides the
ending of the schism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20772src" href=
"#xd25e20772" name="xd25e20772src">4</a> But the Council itself was
followed by seven hundred prostitutes;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20777src" href="#xd25e20777" name="xd25e20777src">5</a> and its
relation to the intellectual life was defined by its bringing about, on
a charge of heresy, the burning of John Huss, who had come under a
letter of safe-conduct from the emperor. The baseness of the act was an
enduring blot on the Church; and a hundred years later, in a Germany
with small goodwill to Bohemia, Luther made it one of his foremost
indictments of the hierarchy. But in the interim the spirit of reform
had come to nothing. Cut off from much of the force that was needed to
effect any great moral revolution in the Church, the reforming movement
soon fell away,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20783src" href="#xd25e20783"
name="xd25e20783src">6</a> and the Church was left to ripen for later
and more drastic treatment.</p>
<p>How far, nevertheless, anti-clericalism could go among the scholarly
class even in Italy is seen in the career of one of the leading
humanists of the Renaissance, <span class="sc">Lorenzo Valla</span>
(1406&ndash;1457). In the work of his youth, <i lang="la">De Voluptate
et Vero Bono</i>, a hardy vindication of aggressive
Epicureanism&mdash;at a time when the title of Epicurean stood for
freethinker<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20797src" href="#xd25e20797"
name="xd25e20797src">7</a>&mdash;he plainly sets up a rationalist
standard, affirming that science is founded on reason and Nature, and
that Nature is God. Not content with a theoretic defiance of the faith,
he violently attacked the Church. It was probably to the protection of
Alfonso of Aragon, king of Naples, who though pious was not
pro-clerical,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20803src" href="#xd25e20803"
name="xd25e20803src">8</a> that Valla was able to do what he did, above
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>all to write his famous treatise, <i lang=
"la">De falso credita et ementita Constantini donatione</i>, wherein he
definitely proved once for all that the &ldquo;donation&rdquo; in
question was a fiction.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20815src" href=
"#xd25e20815" name="xd25e20815src">9</a> Such an opinion had been
earlier maintained at the Council of Basle by &AElig;neas Sylvius,
afterwards Pope Pius II, and before him by the remarkable Nicolaus of
Cusa;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20823src" href="#xd25e20823" name=
"xd25e20823src">10</a> but when the existence of Valla&rsquo;s work was
known he had to fly from Rome afresh (1443) to Naples, where he had
previously been protected for seven years. Applying the same critical
spirit to more sacrosanct literature, he impugned the authenticity of
the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, and of the letter of Abgarus to Jesus
Christ, given by Eusebius; proceeding further to challenge many of the
mistranslations in the Vulgate.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20826src"
href="#xd25e20826" name="xd25e20826src">11</a> For his untiring
propaganda he was summoned before the Inquisition at Naples, but as
usual was protected by the king, whom he satisfied by professing faith
in the dogmas of the Church, as distinguished from ecclesiastical
history and philology.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of the life of Italy, hopelessly committed on
economic grounds to the Church, that Valla finally sought and found
reconciliation with the papacy. He knew that his safety at Naples
depended on the continued anti-papalism of the throne; he yearned for
the society of Rome; and his heart was all the while with the cause of
Latin scholarship rather than with that of a visionary reformation. In
his as in so many cases, accordingly, intellectual rectitude gave way
to lower interests; and he made unblushing offers of retractation to
cardinals and pope. In view of the extreme violence of his former
attacks,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20837src" href="#xd25e20837" name=
"xd25e20837src">12</a> it is not surprising that the reigning Pope,
Eugenius IV, refused to be appeased; but on the election of Nicholas V
(1447) he was sent for; and he died secretary to the Curia and Canon of
St. John Lateran.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20843src" href=
"#xd25e20843" name="xd25e20843src">13</a></p>
<p>Where so much of anti-clericalism could find harbourage within the
Church, there was naturally no lack of it without; and from the period
of Boccaccio till the Catholic reaction after the Reformation a large
measure of anti-clerical feeling is a constant feature in Italian life.
It was so ingrained that the Church had on the whole to leave it alone.
From pope to monk the mass of the clergy had forfeited respect; and
gibes at their expense were household words,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20848src" href="#xd25e20848" name="xd25e20848src">14</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>and the basis of popular songs. Tommaso Guardati
of Salerno, better known as Masuccio, attacks all orders of clergy in
his collection of tales with such fury that only the protection of the
court of Naples could well have saved him; and yet he was a good
Catholic.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20859src" href="#xd25e20859" name=
"xd25e20859src">15</a> The popular poetic literature, with certain
precautions, carried the anti-clerical spirit as far as to parade a
humorous non-literary skepticism, putting in the mouths of the
questionable characters in its romances all manner of anti-religious
opinions which it would be unsafe to print as one&rsquo;s own, but
which in this way reached appreciative readers who were more or less in
sympathy with the author&rsquo;s sentiments and stratagems. The
<i>Morgante Maggiore</i> of <span class="sc">Pulci</span> (1488) is the
great type of such early Voltairean humour:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20875src" href="#xd25e20875" name="xd25e20875src">16</a> it
revives the spirit of the Goliards, and passes unscathed in the new
Renaissance world, where the earlier Proven&ccedil;al impiety had gone
the way of the Inquisition bonfire, books and men alike. Beneath its
mockery there is a constant play of rational thought, and every phase
of contemporary culture is glanced at in the spirit of always
unembittered humour which makes Pulci &ldquo;the most lovable among the
great poets of the Renaissance.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20887src" href="#xd25e20887" name="xd25e20887src">17</a> It is
noteworthy that Pulci is found affirming the doctrine of an Antipodes
with absolute openness, and with impunity, over a hundred years before
Galileo. This survival of ancient pagan science seems to have been
obscurely preserved all through the Middle Ages. In the eighth century,
as we have seen, the priest Feargal or Vergilius, of Bavaria, was
deposed from his office by the Pope, on the urging of St. Boniface, for
maintaining it; but he was reinstated, died a bishop, and became a
saint; and not only that doctrine, but that of the two-fold motion of
the earth, was affirmed with impunity before Pulci by Nicolaus of
Cusa<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20893src" href="#xd25e20893" name=
"xd25e20893src">18</a> (d. 1464); though in the fourteenth century
Nicolaus of Autricuria had to recant his teaching of the atomistic
theory.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20896src" href="#xd25e20896" name=
"xd25e20896src">19</a> As Pulci had specially satirized the clergy and
ecclesiastical miracles, his body was refused burial in consecrated
ground; but the general temper was such as to save him from clerical
enmity up to that point.</p>
<p>The Inquisition too was now greatly enfeebled throughout central and
northern as well as southern Italy. In 1440 the materialist,
mathematician, and astrologer Amadeo de&rsquo; Landi, of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>Milan, was accused of heresy by the orthodox
Franciscans. Not only was he acquitted, but his chief accuser was
condemned in turn to make public retractation, which he however
declined to do.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20903src" href="#xd25e20903"
name="xd25e20903src">20</a> Fifty years later the Inquisition was still
nearly powerless. In 1497 we find a freethinking physician at Bologna,
Gabriele de Sal&ograve;, protected by his patrons against its wrath,
although he &ldquo;was in the habit of maintaining that Christ was not
God, but the son of Joseph and Mary &hellip;; that by his cunning he
had deceived the world; that he may have died on the cross on account
of crimes which he had committed,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20906src" href="#xd25e20906" name="xd25e20906src">21</a> and so
forth. Nineteen years before, Galeotto Marcio had come near being
burned for writing that any man who lived uprightly according to his
own conscience would go to heaven, whatever his faith; and it needed
the Pope, Sixtus IV, his former pupil, to save him from the
Inquisition.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20909src" href="#xd25e20909"
name="xd25e20909src">22</a> Others, who went further, ran similar
risks; and in 1500 Giorgio da Novara was burned at Bologna,
presumptively for denying the divinity of Jesus.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20914src" href="#xd25e20914" name="xd25e20914src">23</a> A bishop
of Aranda, however, is said to have done the same with impunity, in the
same year,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20920src" href="#xd25e20920"
name="xd25e20920src">24</a> besides rejecting hell and purgatory, and
denouncing indulgences as a device of the popes to fill their
pockets.</p>
<p>During this period too the philosophy of Averro&euml;s, as set forth
in his &ldquo;Great Commentary&rdquo; on Aristotle, was taught in North
Italy with an outspokenness not before known. Gaetano of Siena began to
lecture on the Commentary at Padua in 1436; it was in part printed
there in 1472; and from 1471 to 1499 Nicoletto Vernias seems to have
taught, in the Paduan chair of philosophy, the Averro&iuml;st doctrine
of the world-soul, thus virtually denying the Christian doctrine of
immortality. Violent opposition was raised when his pupil Niphus (Nifo)
printed similar doctrine in a treatise <i lang="la">De Intellectu et
D&aelig;monibus</i> (1492); but the professors when necessary
disclaimed the more dangerous tenets of Averro&iuml;sm.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e20933src" href="#xd25e20933" name=
"xd25e20933src">25</a> Nifo it was who put into print the maxim of his
tribe: <i lang="la">Loquendum est ut plures, sententiendum ut
pauci</i>&mdash;&ldquo;think with the few; speak with the
majority.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20945src" href=
"#xd25e20945" name="xd25e20945src">26</a></p>
<p>As in ancient Greece, humorous blasphemy seems to have fared better
than serious unbelief.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20963src" href=
"#xd25e20963" name="xd25e20963src">27</a> As is remarked by Hallam, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>number of vindications of Christianity produced
in Italy in the fifteenth century proves the existence of much
unbelief;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e20977src" href="#xd25e20977" name=
"xd25e20977src">28</a> and it is clear that, apart from academic doubt,
there was abundant freethinking among men of the world.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e20982src" href="#xd25e20982" name=
"xd25e20982src">29</a> Erasmus was astonished at the unbelief he found
in high quarters in Rome. One ecclesiastic undertook to prove to him
from Pliny that there is no future state; others openly derided Christ
and the apostles; and many avowed to him that they had heard eminent
papal functionaries blaspheming the Mass.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e20988src" href="#xd25e20988" name="xd25e20988src">30</a> The
biographer of Pope Paul II has recorded how that pontiff found in his
own court, among certain young men, the opinion that faith rested
rather on trickeries of the saints (<i lang="la">sanctorum
astutiis</i>) than on evidence; which opinion the Pope
eradicated.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21000src" href="#xd25e21000"
name="xd25e21000src">31</a> But in the career of Perugino
(1446&ndash;1524), who from being a sincerely religious painter became
a skeptic in his wrath against the Church which slew
Savonarola,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21003src" href="#xd25e21003"
name="xd25e21003src">32</a> we have evidence of a movement of things
which no papal fiat could arrest.</p>
<p>As to the beliefs of the great artists in general we have little
information. Employed as they so often were in painting religious
subjects for the churches, they must as a rule have conformed
outwardly; and the artistic temper is more commonly credent than
skeptical. But in the case of one of the greatest, <span class=
"sc">Leonardo da Vinci</span> (1452&ndash;1519), we have evidence of a
continual play of critical scrutiny on the world, and a continual
revolt against mere authority, which seem incompatible with any
acceptance of Christian dogma. In his many notes, unpublished till
modern times, his universal genius plays so freely upon so many
problems that he cannot be supposed to have ignored those of religion.
His stern appraisement of the mass of men<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21021src" href="#xd25e21021" name="xd25e21021src">33</a> carries
with it no evangelical qualifications; his passion for knowledge is not
Christian;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21030src" href="#xd25e21030"
name="xd25e21030src">34</a> and his reiterated rejection of the

practise reticence, cannot have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371"
href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>been inwardly docile to
either priesthood or tradition. In all his reflections upon philosophic
and scientific themes he is, in the scientific sense,
materialistic&mdash;that is, inductive, studious of experiment,
insistent upon tangible data.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21052src"
href="#xd25e21052" name="xd25e21052src">37</a> &ldquo;Wisdom is

href="#xd25e21072" name="xd25e21072src">41</a>&mdash;such are the dicta
he accumulates in an age of superstition heightened by the mutability
of life, of ecclesiastical tyranny tempered only by indifferentism, of
faith in astrology and amulets, of benumbing tradition in science and
philosophy. On the problem of the phenomena of fossil shells he
pronounces with a searching sagacity of inference<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21078src" href="#xd25e21078" name="xd25e21078src">42</a> that
seems to reveal at once the extent to which the advance of science has
been blocked by pious obscurantism.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21086src" href="#xd25e21086" name="xd25e21086src">43</a> In all
directions we see the great artist, a century before Bacon,
anticipating Bacon&rsquo;s protests and questionings, and this with no
such primary bias to religion as Bacon had acquired at his
mother&rsquo;s knee. When he turns to the problems of body and spirit
he is as dispassionate, as keenly speculative, as over those of
external nature.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21089src" href=
"#xd25e21089" name="xd25e21089src">44</a> Of magic he is entirely

expressive of a vague theism;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21105src"

thrusts at religious fraud and absurdity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21110src" href="#xd25e21110" name="xd25e21110src">47</a> It is
indeed improbable that a mind so necessitated to discourse of its
thought, however gifted for prudent silence, can have subsisted without
private sympathy from kindred souls. Skepticism was admittedly
abundant; and Leonardo of all men can least have failed to reckon with
its motives.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most fashionable form of quasi-freethinking in the Italy
of the fifteenth century was that which prevailed in the Platonic
Academy of Florence in the period, though the chief founder of the
Academy, Marsilio Ficino, wrote a defence of Christianity, and his most
famous adherent, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, planned another.
Renaissance Platonism began with the Greek Georgios Gemistos, surnamed
Plethon because of his devotion to Plato, which was such as to
scandalize common Christians and exasperate Aristotelians. The former
had the real <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>grievance that his system ostensibly embodied
polytheism and logically involved pantheism;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21119src" href="#xd25e21119" name="xd25e21119src">48</a> and one
of his antagonists, Gennadios Georgios Scolarios, who became patriarch
of Constantinople, caused his book <i>On Laws</i> to be
burned;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21137src" href="#xd25e21137" name=
"xd25e21137src">49</a> but the allegation of his Aristotelian enemy and
countryman, Georgios Trapezuntios, that he prayed to the sun as creator
of the world,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21143src" href="#xd25e21143"
name="xd25e21143src">50</a> is only one of the polemical amenities of
the period. Ostensibly he was a believing Christian, stretching
Christian love to accommodate the beliefs of Plato; but it was not zeal
for orthodoxy that moved Cosimo dei Medici, at Florence, to embrace the
new Platonism, and train up Marsilio Ficino to be its prophet. The
<i lang="la">furor allegoricus</i> which inspired the whole
school<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21153src" href="#xd25e21153" name=
"xd25e21153src">51</a> was much more akin to ancient Gnosticism than to
orthodox Christianity, and constantly points to pantheism<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e21159src" href="#xd25e21159" name=
"xd25e21159src">52</a> as the one philosophic solution of its
ostensible polytheism. When, too, Ficino undertakes to vindicate
Christianity against the unbelievers in his <i lang="it">Della
Religione Cristiana</i>, &ldquo;the most solid arguments that he can
find in its favour are the answers of the Sibyls, and the prophecies of
the coming of Jesus Christ to be found in Virgil, Plato, Plotinus, and
Porphyry.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21168src" href=
"#xd25e21168" name="xd25e21168src">53</a></p>
<p>How far such a spirit of expatiation and speculation, however
visionary and confused, tended to foster heresy is seen in the brief
career of the once famous young Pico della Mirandola, Ficino&rsquo;s
wealthy pupil. Parading a portentous knowledge of tongues<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e21181src" href="#xd25e21181" name=
"xd25e21181src">54</a> and topics at the age of twenty-four, he
undertook (1486) to maintain a list of nine hundred <i lang=
"la">Conclusiones</i> or propositions at Rome against all comers, and
to pay their expenses. Though he had obtained the permission of the
Pope, Innocent VIII, the challenge speedily elicited angry charges of
heresy against certain of the theses, and the Pope had to stop the
proceedings and issue an ecclesiastical commission of inquiry. Some of
the propositions were certainly ill adjusted to Catholic ideas, in
particular the sayings that &ldquo;neither the cross of Christ nor any
image is to be adored <i lang="la">adoratione
latri&aelig;</i>&rdquo;&mdash;with worship; that no one believes what
he believes merely because he wishes to; and that Jesus did not
physically descend into hell.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21198src"

an <i>Apologia</i>, which provoked fresh outcry; whereupon he was
summoned to proceed to Rome; and though the powerful friendship of
Lorenzo dei Medici procured a countermand of the order, it was not till
1496 that he received, from Alexander VI, a full papal remission.</p>
<p>Among the unachieved projects of his later life, which ended at the
age of thirty-one, was that of a treatise <i lang="la">Adversus Hostes
Ecclesi&aelig;</i>, to be divided into seven sections, the first
dealing with &ldquo;The avowed and open enemies of Christianity,&rdquo;
and the second with &ldquo;Atheists and those who reject every
religious system upon their own reasoning&rdquo;; and the others with
Jews, Moslems, idolaters, heretics, and unrighteous believers.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e21221src" href="#xd25e21221" name=
"xd25e21221src">56</a> The vogue of unbelief thus signified was
probably increased by the whole speculative habit of Pico&rsquo;s own
school,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21224src" href="#xd25e21224" name=
"xd25e21224src">57</a> which tended only less than Averro&iuml;sm to a
pantheism subversive of the Christian creed. It is noteworthy that,
while Ficino believed devoutly in astrology,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21233src" href="#xd25e21233" name="xd25e21233src">58</a> Pico
rejected it, and left among his confused papers a treatise against it
which his nephew contrived to transcribe and publish;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e21239src" href="#xd25e21239" name="xd25e21239src">59</a> but
it does not appear that this served either the cause of religion or
that of science. The educated Italian world, while political
independence lasted, remained in various degrees freethinking,
pantheistic, and given to astrology, no school or teacher combining
rationalism in philosophy with sound scientific methods.</p>
<p>One of the great literary figures of the later Renaissance,
<span class="sc">Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli</span> (1469&ndash;1527),
is the standing proof of the divorce of the higher intelligence of
Italy from the faith as well as the cause of the Church before the
Reformation. With this divorce he expressly charges the Church itself,
giving as the first proof of its malfeasance that the peoples nearest
Rome were the least religious.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21247src"
href="#xd25e21247" name="xd25e21247src">60</a> To him the Church was
the supreme evil in Italian politics,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21252src" href="#xd25e21252" name="xd25e21252src">61</a> the
&ldquo;stone in the wound.&rdquo; In a famous passage he gives his
opinion that &ldquo;our religion, having shown us the truth and the
true way, makes us esteem less political honour (<i lang=
"it">l&rsquo;onore del mondo</i>)&rdquo;; and that whereas the pagan
religion canonized only men crowned with public honour, as generals and
statesmen, &ldquo;our religion has glorified rather the humble and
contemplative men than the active,&rdquo; placing the highest good in
humility and abjection, teaching rather to suffer than to do, and so
making the world debile and ready to be a prey <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>to
scoundrels.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21266src" href="#xd25e21266"
name="xd25e21266src">62</a> The passage which follows, putting the
blame on men for thus misreading their religion, is a fair sample of
the grave mockery with which the men of that age veiled their
unfaith.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21271src" href="#xd25e21271" name=
"xd25e21271src">63</a> Machiavelli was reputed in his own world an
atheist;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21274src" href="#xd25e21274" name=
"xd25e21274src">64</a> and he certainly was no religionist. He indeed
never avows atheism, but neither did any other writer of the
epoch;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21292src" href="#xd25e21292" name=
"xd25e21292src">65</a> and the whole tenour of his writings is that of
a man who had at least put aside the belief in a prayer-answering
deity;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21298src" href="#xd25e21298" name=
"xd25e21298src">66</a> though, with the intellectual arbitrariness
which still affected all the thought of his age, he avows a belief that
all great political changes are heralded by prodigies, celestial signs,
prophecies, or revelations<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21304src" href=
"#xd25e21304" name="xd25e21304src">67</a>&mdash;here conforming to the
ordinary superstition of his troublous time.</p>
<p>It belongs, further, to the manifold self-contradiction of the
Renaissance that, holding none of the orthodox religious beliefs, he
argues insistently and at length for the value and importance of
religion, however untrue, as a means to political strength. Through
five successive chapters of his <i>Discourses on Livy</i> he presses
and illustrates his thesis, praising Numa as a sagacious framer of
useful fictions, and as setting up new and false beliefs which made for
the unification and control of the Roman people. The argument evolved
with such strange candour is, of course, of the nature of so much
Renaissance science, an &agrave; priori error: there was no lack of
religious faith and fear in primitive Rome before the age of Numa; and
the legend concerning him is a product of the very primordial
mythopoiesis which Machiavelli supposes him to have set on foot. It is
in the spirit of that fallacious theory of a special superinduced
religiosity in Romans<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21314src" href=
"#xd25e21314" name="xd25e21314src">68</a> that the great Florentine
proceeds to charge the Church with having made the Italians
religionless and vicious (<i lang="it">senza religione e cattivi</i>).
Had he lived a century or two later he might have seen in the case of
zealously believing Spain a completer political and social prostration
than had fallen in his day on Italy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb375" href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>and this alongside of
regeneration in an unbelieving France. But indeed it was the bitterness
of spirit of a suffering patriot looking back yearningly to an
idealized Rome, rather than the insight of the author of <i>The
Prince</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21326src" href="#xd25e21326"
name="xd25e21326src">69</a> that inspired his reasoning on the
political uses of religion; for at the height of his exposition he
notes, with his keen eye for fact, how the most strenuous use of
religious motive had failed to support the Samnites against the cool
courage of Romans led by a rationalizing general;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21332src" href="#xd25e21332" name="xd25e21332src">70</a> and he
notes, too, with a sardonic touch of hopefulness, how Savonarola had
contrived to persuade the people of contemporary Florence that he had
intercourse with deity.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21337src" href=
"#xd25e21337" name="xd25e21337src">71</a> Italy then had faith enough
and to spare.</p>
<p>Such argument, in any case, even if untouched by the irony which
tinges Machiavelli&rsquo;s, could never avail to restore faith; men
cannot become believers on the motive of mere belief in the value of
belief; and the total effect of Machiavelli&rsquo;s manifold reasoning
on human affairs, with its startling lucidity, its constant insistence
on causation, its tacit negation of every notion of Providence, must
have been, in Italy as elsewhere, rather to prepare the way for
inductive science than to rehabilitate supernaturalism, even among
those who assented to his theory of Roman development. In his hands the
method of science begins to emerge, turned to the most difficult of its
tasks, before Copernicus had applied it to the simpler problem of the
motion of the solar system. After centuries in which the name of
Aristotle had been constantly invoked to small scientific purpose, this
man of the world, who knew little or nothing of Aristotle&rsquo;s
<i>Politics</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21350src" href=
"#xd25e21350" name="xd25e21350src">72</a> exhibits the spirit of the
true Aristotle for the first time in the history of Christendom; and it
is in his land after two centuries of his influence that modern
sociology begins its next great stride in the work of Vico.</p>
<p>He is to be understood, of course, as the product of the moral and
intellectual experience of the Renaissance, which prepared his audience
for him. Guicciardini, his contemporary, who in comparison was unblamed
for irreligion, though an even warmer hater of the papacy, has left in
writing the most explicit avowals of incredulity as to the current
conceptions of the supernatural, and declares concerning miracles that
as they occur in every religion they prove none.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21355src" href="#xd25e21355" name="xd25e21355src">73</a> At the
same time he professes firm faith in Christianity;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e21358src" href="#xd25e21358" name="xd25e21358src">74</a> and
others who would not have joined him there were often as inconsistent
in the ready belief they gave to magic <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>and astrology. The
time was, after all, one of artistic splendour and scientific and
critical ignorance;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21363src" href=
"#xd25e21363" name="xd25e21363src">75</a> and its freethought had the
inevitable defects that ignorance entails. Thus the belief in the
reality of witchcraft, sometimes discarded by churchmen,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e21366src" href="#xd25e21366" name=
"xd25e21366src">76</a> is sometimes maintained by heretics. Rejected by
John of Salisbury in the twelfth century, and by the freethinking
Pietro of Abano in 1303, it was affirmed and established by Thomas
Aquinas, asserted by Gregory IX, and made a motive for uncounted
slaughters by the Inquisition. In 1460 a theologian had been forced to
retract, and still punished, for expressing doubt on the subject; and
in 1471 Pope Sixtus VI reserved to the papacy the privilege of making
and selling the waxen models of limbs used as preservatives against
enchantments. In the sixteenth century a whole series of books directed
against the belief were put on the Index, and a Jesuit handbook
codified the creed. Yet a Minorite friar, Alfonso Spina, pronounced it
a heretical delusion, and taught that those burned suffered not for
witchcraft but for heresy,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21373src" href=
"#xd25e21373" name="xd25e21373src">77</a> and on the other hand some
men of a freethinking turn held it. Thus the progress of rational
thought was utterly precarious.</p>
<p>Of the literary freethinking of the later Renaissance the most
famous representative is <span class="sc">Pomponazzi</span>, or
Pomponatius (1462&ndash;1525), for whom it has been claimed that he
&ldquo;really initiated the philosophy of the Italian
Renaissance.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21383src" href=
"#xd25e21383" name="xd25e21383src">78</a> The Italian Renaissance,
however, was in reality near its turning-point when Pomponazzi&rsquo;s
treatise on the Immortality of the Soul appeared (1516); and that topic
was the commonest in the schools and controversies of that
day.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21389src" href="#xd25e21389" name=
"xd25e21389src">79</a> He has been at times spoken of as an
Averro&iuml;st, on the ground that he denied immortality; but he did so
in reality as a disciple of Alexander of Aphrodisias, a rival
commentator to Averro&euml;s. What is remarkable in his case is not the
denial of immortality, which we have seen to be frequent in
Dante&rsquo;s time, and more or less implicit in Averro&iuml;sm, but
his contention that ethics could do very well without the
belief<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21395src" href="#xd25e21395" name=
"xd25e21395src">80</a>&mdash;a thing that it still took some courage to
affirm, though the spectacle of the life of the faithful might have
been supposed sufficient to win it a ready hearing. Presumably his
rationalism, which made him challenge <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb377" href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>the then canonical
authority of the scholasticized Aristotle, went further than his avowed
doubts as to a future state; since his profession of obedience to the
Church&rsquo;s teaching, and his reiteration of the old academic
doctrine of two-fold truth&mdash;one truth for science and philosophy,
and another for theology<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21401src" href=
"#xd25e21401" name="xd25e21401src">81</a>&mdash;are as dubious as any
in philosophic history.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21407src" href=
"#xd25e21407" name="xd25e21407src">82</a> Of him, or of Lorenzo Valla,
more justly than of Petrarch, might it be said that he is the father of
modern criticism, since Valla sets on foot at once historical and
textual analysis, while Pomponazzi anticipates the treatment given to
Biblical miracles by the rationalizing German theologians of the end of
the eighteenth century.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21416src" href=
"#xd25e21416" name="xd25e21416src">83</a> He too was a fixed enemy of
the clergy; and it was not for lack of will that they failed to destroy
him. He happened to be a personal favourite of Leo X, who saw to it
that the storm of opposition to Pomponazzi&mdash;a storm as much of
anger on behalf of Aristotle, who had been shown by him to doubt the
immortality of the soul, as on behalf of Christianity&mdash;should end
in an official farce of reconciliation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21419src" href="#xd25e21419" name="xd25e21419src">84</a> He was
however not free to publish his treatises, <i lang="la">De
Incantationibus</i> and <i lang="la">De Fato, Libero Arbitrio, et
Pr&aelig;destinatione</i>. These, completed in 1520, were not printed
till after his death, in 1556 and 1557;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21429src" href="#xd25e21429" name="xd25e21429src">85</a> and by
reason of their greater simplicity, as well as of their less dangerous
form of heresy, were much more widely read than the earlier treatise,
thus contributing much to the spread of sane thought on the subjects of
witchcraft, miracles, and special providences.</p>
<p>Whether his metaphysic on the subject of the immortality of the soul
had much effect on popular thought may be doubted. What the Renaissance
most needed in both its philosophic and its practical thought was a
scientific foundation; and science, from first to last, was more
hindered than helped by the environment. In the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries, charges of necromancy against physicians and
experimenters were frequently joined with imputations of heresy, and on
such charges not a few were burned.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21436src" href="#xd25e21436" name="xd25e21436src">86</a> The
economic conditions too were all unfavourable to solid research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">When Galileo in 1589 was made Professor of Mathematics
at Pisa, his salary was only 60 scudi (= dollars), while the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=

Gebler, <i>Galileo Galilei</i>, Eng<span class="corr" id="xd25e21447"

Galileo had 520 florins, with a prospect of rising to as many scudi.
(Letter given in <i>The Private Life of Galileo</i>, Boston, 1870, p.
61.) The Grand Duke finally gave him a pension of 1,000 scudi at
Florence. (<i>Id.</i> p. 64.) This squares with Bacon&rsquo;s complaint
(<i>Advancement of Learning</i>, bk. ii; <i lang="la">De Augmentis</i>,
bk. ii, ch. i&mdash;<i>Works</i>, Routledge ed. pp. 76, 422&ndash;23)
that, especially in England, the salaries of lecturers in arts and
professions were injuriously small, and that, further, &ldquo;among so
many noble foundations of colleges in Europe &hellip; they are all
dedicated to professions, and none left free to the study of arts and
sciences at large.&rdquo; In Italy, however, philosophy was fairly well
endowed. Pomponazzi received a salary of 900 Bolognese lire when he
obtained the chair of Philosophy at Bologna in 1509. (Christie, essay
cited, p. 138.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Medicine was nearly as dogmatic as theology. Even philosophy was in
large part shouldered aside by the financial motives which led men to
study law in preference;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21469src" href=
"#xd25e21469" name="xd25e21469src">87</a> and when the revival of
ancient literature gained ground it absorbed energy to the detriment of
scientific study,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21472src" href=
"#xd25e21472" name="xd25e21472src">88</a> the wealthy amateurs being
ready to pay high prices for manuscripts of classics, and for classical
teaching; but not for patient investigation of natural fact. The
humanists, so-called, were often forces of enlightenment and reform;
witness such a type as the high-minded <span class="sc">Pomponio
Leto</span> (Pomponius Laetus), pupil and successor of Lorenzo Valla,
and one of the many &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; scholars of the later
Renaissance;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21478src" href="#xd25e21478"
name="xd25e21478src">89</a> but the discipline of mere classical
culture was insufficient to make them, as a body, qualified leaders
either of thought or action,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21484src" href=
"#xd25e21484" name="xd25e21484src">90</a> in such a society as that of
decaying Italy. Only after the fall of Italian liberties, the decay of
the Church&rsquo;s wealth and power, the loss of commerce, and the
consequent decline of the arts, did men turn to truly scientific
pursuits. From Italy, indeed, long after the Reformation, came a new
stimulus to freethought which affected all the higher civilization of
northern Europe. But the failure to solve the political problem, a
failure which led to the Spanish tyranny, meant the establishment of
bad conditions for the intellectual as for the social life; and an
arrest of freethought in Italy was a necessary accompaniment of the
arrest of the higher literature. What remained was the afterglow of a
great and energetic period rather than a spirit of inquiry; and we find
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>old Averro&iuml;st scholasticism, in its most
pedantic form, lasting at the university of Padua till far into the
seventeenth century. &ldquo;A philosophy,&rdquo; remarks in this
connection an esteemed historian, &ldquo;a mode of thought, a habit of
mind, may live on in the lecture-rooms of Professors for a century
after it has been abandoned by the thinkers, the men of letters, and
the men of the world.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21490src" href=
"#xd25e21490" name="xd25e21490src">91</a> The avowal has its bearings
nearer home than Padua.</p>
<p>While it lasted, the light of Italy had shone upon all the thought
of Europe. Not only the other nations but the scholars of the Jewish
race reflected it; for to the first half of the sixteenth century
belongs the Jew Menahem Asariah de Rossi, whose work, <i>Meor
Enayim</i>, &ldquo;Light of the Eyes,&rdquo; is &ldquo;the first
attempt by a Jew to submit the statements of the Talmud to a critical
examination, and to question the value of tradition in its historical
records.&rdquo; And he did not stand alone among the Jews of Italy;
for, while Elijah Delmedigo, at the end of the fifteenth century, was
in a didactic Maimonist fashion doubtful of literary tradition, his
grandson, Joseph Solomon Delmedigo, flourishing early in the
seventeenth century, &ldquo;wrote various pamphlets of a deeply
skeptical character.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21505src" href=
"#xd25e21505" name="xd25e21505src">92</a> That this movement of Jewish
rationalism should be mainly limited to the south was inevitable, since
there only were Jewish scholars in an intellectual environment. There
could be no better testimony to the higher influence of the Italian
Renaissance.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the other countries influenced by Italian culture
in the sixteenth century the rationalist spirit had various fortune.
France, as we saw, had substantially retrograded at the time of the
Italian new-birth, her revived militarism no less than her depression
by the English conquests having deeply impaired her intellectual life
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Thus the true renascence of
letters in France began late, and went on during the Reformation
period; and all along it showed a tincture of freethought. From the
midst of the group who laid the foundations of French Protestantism by
translations of the Bible there comes forth the most articulate
freethinker of that age, <span class="sc">Bonaventure
Desperiers</span>, author of the <i lang="la">Cymbalum Mundi</i>
(1537). Early associated with Calvin and Olivetan in revising the
translation of the Bible by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href=
"#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>Lef&egrave;vre d&rsquo;Etaples
(rev. 1535), Desperiers turned away from the Protestant movement, as
did Rabelais and &Eacute;tienne Dolet, caring as little for the new
presbyter as for the old priest; and all three were duly accused by the
Protestants of atheism and <i lang="fr">libertinage</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e21529src" href="#xd25e21529" name=
"xd25e21529src">93</a> In the same year Desperiers aided Dolet, scholar
and printer, to produce his much-praised <i lang="la">Commentarii
lingu&aelig; latin&aelig;</i>; and within two years he had printed his
own satire, <i lang="la">Cymbalum Mundi</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21545src" href="#xd25e21545" name="xd25e21545src">94</a> wherein,
by way of pagan dialogues, are allegorically ridiculed the Christian
scheme, its miracles, Bible contradictions, and the spirit of
persecution, then in full fire in France against the Protestants. In
the first dialogue Mercury is sent to Athens by Zeus the Father to have
the &ldquo;Book of the Destinies&rdquo; rebound&mdash;an adaptation of
an ancient sarcasm against the Christians by Celsus.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e21563src" href="#xd25e21563" name="xd25e21563src">95</a> He,
robbing others, is robbed of the book, and another (= the New
Testament) is put in its place. In the second dialogue figure Rhetulus
(= Lutherus) and Cubercus (= Bucerus?), who suppose they have found the
main pieces of the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, which Mercury had broken
and scattered in the sand of the theatre arena. Protestants and
Catholics are thus alike ridiculed. The allegory is not always clear to
modern eyes; but there was no question then about its general bearing;
and Desperiers, though groom of the chamber (after Clement Marot) to
Marguerite of France (later of Navarre), had to fly for his life, as
Marot did before him. The first edition of his book, secretly printed
at Paris, was seized and destroyed; and the second (1538), printed for
him at Lyons, whither he had taken his flight, seems to have had a
similar fate. From that time he disappears, probably dying, whether or
not by suicide is doubtful,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21569src" href=
"#xd25e21569" name="xd25e21569src">96</a> before 1544, when his
miscellaneous works were published. They include his <i lang=
"fr">&OElig;uvres Diverses</i>&mdash;many of them graceful poems
addressed to his royal mistress, Marguerite&mdash;which, with his verse
translation of the <i>Andria</i> of Terence and his <i lang=
"fr">Discours non plus Melancoliques que Divers</i>, make up his small
body of work. In the <i lang="fr">Discours</i> may be seen applied to
matters of history and scholarship the same critical spirit that utters
itself in the <i lang="la">Cymbalum</i>, and the same literary gift;
but for orthodoxy his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href=
"#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>name became a hissing and a
byword, and it is only in modern times that French scholarship has
recognized in Desperiers the true literary comrade and potential equal
of Rabelais and Marot.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21601src" href=
"#xd25e21601" name="xd25e21601src">97</a> The age of Francis was too
inclement for such literature as his <i lang="la">Cymbalum</i>; and it
was much that it spared Gringoire (d. 1544), who, without touching
doctrine, satirized in his verse both priests and Protestants.</p>
<p>It is something of a marvel, further, that it spared <span class=
"sc">Rabelais</span> (? 1493&ndash;1553), whose enormous raillery so
nearly fills up the literary vista of the age for modern retrospect. It
has been said by a careful student that &ldquo;the free and universal
inquiry, the philosophic doubt, which were later to work the glory of
Descartes, proceed from Rabelais&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21616src" href="#xd25e21616" name="xd25e21616src">98</a> and it
is indeed an impression of boundless intellectual curiosity and wholly
unfettered thinking that is set up by his entire career. Sent first to
the convent school of La Baumette, near Angers, he had there as a
schoolfellow Geoffroy d&rsquo;Estissac, afterwards his patron as Bishop
of Maillezais. Sent later to the convent school of Fontenay-le-Comte,
he had the luck to have for schoolfellows there the four famous
brothers Du Bellay, so well able to protect him in later life; and,
forced to spend fifteen years of his young life (1509&ndash;24) at
Fontenay as a Franciscan monk, he turned the time to account by
acquiring an immense erudition, including a knowledge of Greek, then
rare.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21622src" href="#xd25e21622" name=
"xd25e21622src">99</a> Naturally the book-lover was not popular among
his fellow-monks; and his Greek books were actually confiscated by the
chapter, who found in his cell certain writings of Erasmus,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e21633src" href="#xd25e21633" name=
"xd25e21633src">100</a> to whom as a scholar he afterwards expressed
the deepest intellectual obligations. Thereafter, by the help of his
friend d&rsquo;Estissac, now bishop of the diocese, Rabelais received
papal permission to join the order of the Benedictines and to enter the
Abbey of Maillezais as a canon regular (1524); but soon after, though
he was thus a fully-ordained priest, we find him broken loose, and
living for some six years a life of wandering freedom as a secular
priest, sometimes with his friend the bishop, winning friends in high
places by his learning and his gaiety, everywhere studying and
observing. At the bishop&rsquo;s priory of Ligug&eacute; he seems to
have studied hard and widely. In 1530 he is found at Montpellier,
extending his studies in medicine, in which he speedily won
distinction, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>becoming B.M. on December 1, and a lecturer in
the following year. He was later esteemed one of the chief anatomists
of his day, being one of the first to dissect the human body and to
insist on the need of such training for physicians;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e21642src" href="#xd25e21642" name="xd25e21642src">101</a> and
in 1532<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21651src" href="#xd25e21651" name=

great universal spirit of this time.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21660src" href="#xd25e21660" name="xd25e21660src">103</a> In the
same year he published at Lyons, where he was appointed physician to
the chief hospital, an edition of the Latin letters of the Ferrarese
physician Manardi; and his own commentaries on Galen and Hippocrates,
which had a very poor sale.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21663src" href=
"#xd25e21663" name="xd25e21663src">104</a> At Lyons he made the
acquaintance of Dolet, Marot, and Desperiers; and his letter (of the
same year) to Erasmus (printed as addressed to Bernard de
Salignac<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21666src" href="#xd25e21666" name=
"xd25e21666src">105</a>) showed afresh how his intellectual sympathies
went.</p>
<p>About 1532 he produced his <i>Gargantua</i> and <i>Pantagruel</i>,
the first two books of his great humoristic romance; and in 1533 began
his series of almanacks, continued till 1550, presumably as
printer&rsquo;s hack-work. From the fragments which have been
preserved, they appear to have been entirely serious in tone, one
containing a grave theistic protest against all astrological
prediction. Along with the almanack of 1533, however, he produced a
<i>Pantagruelian Prognostication</i>; and this, which alone has been
preserved entire,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21680src" href=
"#xd25e21680" name="xd25e21680src">106</a> passes hardy ridicule on
astrology,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21683src" href="#xd25e21683"
name="xd25e21683src">107</a> one of the most popular superstitions of
the day, among high and low alike. Almost immediately the Sorbonne was
on his track, condemning his <i>Pantagruel</i> in 1533.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e21690src" href="#xd25e21690" name=
"xd25e21690src">108</a> A journey soon afterwards to Rome, in the
company of his friend Bishop Jean du Bellay, the French ambassador, may
have saved him some personal experience of persecution. Two years
later, when the Bishop went to Rome to be made cardinal, Rabelais again
accompanied him; and he appears to have been a favourite alike with
Pope Clement VII and Paul III. At the end of 1535 we find him, in a
letter to his patron, the bishop of Maillezais, scoffing at the
astrological leanings of the new Pope, Paul III.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21693src" href="#xd25e21693" name="xd25e21693src">109</a>
Nonetheless, upon a formal <i lang="la">Supplicatio pro apostasia</i>,
he obtained from the Pope in 1536 an absolution for his breach of his
monastic vows, with permission to practise medicine in a Benedictine
monastery. Shortly before, his little son Th&eacute;odule had
died;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21702src" href="#xd25e21702" name=
"xd25e21702src">110</a> and it may have been grief that inspired such a
desire: in any case, the papal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383"
href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>permission to turn monk again
was never used,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21708src" href="#xd25e21708"
name="xd25e21708src">111</a> though the pardon was doubtless
serviceable. Taking his degree as doctor at Montpellier in May, 1537,
he there lectured for about a year on anatomy; and in the middle of
1538 he recommenced a wandering life,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21711src" href="#xd25e21711" name="xd25e21711src">112</a>
practising in turn at Narbonne, Castres, and Lyons. Then, after
becoming a Benedictine canon of St. Maur in 1540, we find him in
Piedmont from 1540 to 1543, under the protection of the viceroy,
Guillaume de Bellay.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21714src" href=
"#xd25e21714" name="xd25e21714src">113</a></p>
<p>During this period the frequent reprints of the first two books of
his main work, though never bearing his name, brought upon him the
denunciations alike of priests and Protestants. Ramus, perhaps in
revenge for being caricatured as Raminagrobis, pronounced him an
atheist.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21719src" href="#xd25e21719" name=
"xd25e21719src">114</a> Calvin, who had once been his friend, had in
his book <i lang="la">De Scandalis</i> angrily accused him of <i lang=
"fr">libertinage</i>, profanity, and atheism; and henceforth, like
Desperiers, he was about as little in sympathy with Protestantism as
with the zealots of Rome.</p>
<p>Thus assailed, Rabelais had seen cause, in an edition of 1542, to
modify a number of the hardier utterances in the original issues of the
first two books of his <i>Pantagruel</i>, notably his many epithets
aimed at the Sorbonne.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21736src" href=
"#xd25e21736" name="xd25e21736src">115</a> In the reprints there are
substituted for Biblical names some drawn from heathen mythology;
expressions too strongly savouring of Calvinism are withdrawn; and
disrespectful allusions to the kings of France are elided. In his
concern to keep himself safe with the Sorbonne he even made a rather
unworthy attack<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21761src" href="#xd25e21761"
name="xd25e21761src">116</a> (1542) on his former friend &Eacute;tienne
Dolet for the mere oversight of reprinting one of his books without
deleting passages which Rabelais had expunged;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21767src" href="#xd25e21767" name="xd25e21767src">117</a> but no
expurgation could make his <i lang="fr">&eacute;vangile</i>, as he
called it,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21783src" href="#xd25e21783"
name="xd25e21783src">118</a> a Christian treatise, or keep for him an
orthodox reputation; and it was with much elation that he obtained in
1545 from King Francis&mdash;whose private reader was his friend
Duch&acirc;tel, Bishop of Tulle&mdash;a privilege to print the third
book <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>of <i>Pantagruel</i>, which he issued in 1546,
signed for the first time with his name, and prefaced by a cry of
jovial defiance to the &ldquo;petticoated devils&rdquo; of the
Sorbonne. They at once sought to convict him of fresh blasphemies; but
even the thrice-repeated substitution of an <i>n</i> for an <i>m</i> in
<i lang="fr">&acirc;me</i>, making &ldquo;ass&rdquo; out of
&ldquo;soul,&rdquo; was carried off, by help of Bishop Duch&acirc;tel,
as a printer&rsquo;s error; and the king, having laughed like other
readers, maintained the imprimatur. But although it gave Rabelais
formal leave to reprint the first and second books, he was careful for
the time not to do so, leaving the increasing risk to be run by whoso
would.</p>
<p>It was on the death of Francis in 1547 that Rabelais ran his
greatest danger, having to fly to Metz, where for a time he acted as
salaried physician of the city. About this time he seems to have
written the fourth and fifth books of <i>Pantagruel</i>; and to the
treatment he had suffered at Catholic hands has been ascribed the
reversion to Calvinistic ideas noted in the fifth book.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e21807src" href="#xd25e21807" name=
"xd25e21807src">119</a> In 1549, however, on the birth of a son to
Henri II, his friend Cardinal Bellay returned to power, and Rabelais to
court favour with him. The derider of astrology did not scruple to cast
a prosperous horoscope for the infant prince&mdash;justifying by
strictly false predictions his own estimate of the art, since the child
died in the cradle. There was now effected the dramatic scandal of the
appointment of Rabelais in 1550 to two parish cures, one of which,
Meudon, has given him his most familiar <i lang="fr">sobriquet</i>. He
seems to have left both to be served by vicars;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21813src" href="#xd25e21813" name="xd25e21813src">120</a> but the
wrath of the Church was so great that early in 1552 he resigned
them;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21819src" href="#xd25e21819" name=
"xd25e21819src">121</a> proceeding immediately afterwards to publish
the fourth book of <i>Pantagruel</i>, for which he had duly obtained
official privilege. As usual, the Sorbonne rushed to the pursuit; and
the Parlement of Paris forbade the sale of the book despite the royal
permission. That permission, however, was reaffirmed; and this, the
most audacious of all the writings of Rabelais, went forth freely
throughout France, carrying the war into the enemies&rsquo; camp, and
assailing alike Protestants and churchmen. In the following year, his
work done, he died.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the intellectual effect of his
performance, which was probably much greater at the end of the century
than during his life. Patericke, the English translator <span class=

Gentillet&rsquo;s famous <i lang="fr">Discours</i> against Machiavelli
(1576), points to Rabelais among the French and Agrippa (an odd
parallel) among the Germans as the standard-bearers of the whole train
of atheists and scoffers. &ldquo;Little by little, that which was taken
in the beginning for jests turned to earnest, and words into
deeds.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21833src" href="#xd25e21833"

<p>Dolet (1508&ndash;1546) was certainly much less of an

his boyhood at Paris; later at Padua, under Simon Villanovanus, whom he
heard converse with Sir Thomas More; then, at 21, for a year at Venice,
where he was secretary to Langeac, the French Bishop of Limoges. It was
at Toulouse, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>where he went in 1532 to study law, that he
began his quarrels and his troubles. In that year, and in that town,
the young Jean de Caturce, a lecturer in the school of law, was burned
alive on a trivial charge of heresy; and Dolet witnessed the
tragedy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21932src" href="#xd25e21932" name=
"xd25e21932src">136</a> Previously there had been a wholesale arrest of

id="xd25e21935src" href="#xd25e21935" name="xd25e21935src">137</a>
Thirty-two saved themselves by flight; but among those arrested was
Jean de Boysonne, the most learned and the ablest professor in the
university, much admired by Rabelais,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21938src" href="#xd25e21938" name="xd25e21938src">138</a> and
afterwards the most intimate friend of Dolet. It was his sheer love of
letters that brought upon him the charge of heresy;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e21941src" href="#xd25e21941" name="xd25e21941src">139</a> but
he was forced publicly to abjure ten Lutheran heresies charged upon
him. The students of the time were divided in the old fashion into
&ldquo;nations,&rdquo; and formed societies as such; and Dolet, chosen
in 1534 as &ldquo;orator&rdquo; of the &ldquo;French&rdquo; group, as
distinct from the Gascons and the Tolosans, in the course of a quarrel
of the societies delivered two Latin orations, in one of which he
vilipended alike the cruelty and the superstitions of Toulouse. A
number of the leading bigots of the place were attacked; and Dolet was
after an interval of some months thrown into prison, charged with
exciting a riot and with contempt of the Parlement of Toulouse. His
incarceration did not last long; but never thereafter was he safe; and
in the remaining thirteen years of his life he was five more times in
prison, for nearly five years in all.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21944src" href="#xd25e21944" name="xd25e21944src">140</a></p>
<p>After he had settled at Lyons, and produced his <i>Commentaries</i>,
he had the bad fortune to kill an enemy who drew sword upon him; and
the pardon he obtained from the king through the influence of
Marguerite of Navarre remained technically unratified for six years,
during which time he was only provisionally at liberty, being actually
in prison for a short time in 1537. Apart from this episode he showed
himself both quarrelsome and vainglorious, alienating friends who had
done much for him; but his enemies were worse spirits than he. The
power of the man drove him to perpetual production no less than to
strife; and his mere activity as a printer went far to destroy him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">&ldquo;No calling was more hateful to the friends of
bigotry and superstition than that of a printer&rdquo; (Christie, as
cited, p. 387). Nearly all the leading printers of France and Germany
were either avowedly in sympathy with Protestant heresy or suspected
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>of being so (<i>id.</i> p. 388); and the issue
of an edict by King Francis in 1535 for the suppression of printing was
at the instance of the Sorbonne. We shall see that in Germany the
support of the printers, and their hostility to the priests and monks,
contributed greatly to the success of Lutheranism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1542 he was indicted as a heretic, but really for publishing
Protestant books of devotion and French translations of the Bible.
Among the formal offences charged were: (1) his having in his <i lang=
"la">Cato Christianus</i> cited as the second commandment the
condemnation of all images; (2) his use of the term &ldquo;fate&rdquo;
in the sense of predestination; (3) his substitution of <i lang=
"la">habeo fidem for credo</i>; (4) the eating of flesh in Lent; and
(5) the act of taking a walk during the performance of mass.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e21972src" href="#xd25e21972" name=
"xd25e21972src">141</a> On this indictment the two inquisitors Orry and
Faye delivered him over to the secular arm for execution. Again he
secured the King&rsquo;s pardon (1543), through the mediation of Pierre
Duch&acirc;tel, the good Bishop of Tulle; but the ecclesiastical
resistance was such that, despite Dolet&rsquo;s formal recantation, it
required a more plenary pardon, the express orders of the King, and
three official letters to secure his release after a year&rsquo;s
detention.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21977src" href="#xd25e21977"
name="xd25e21977src">142</a></p>
<p>That was, however, swiftly followed by a final and successful
prosecution. By a base device two parcels were made of prohibited books
printed by Dolet and of Protestant books issued at Geneva; and these,
bearing his name in large, were forwarded to Paris. The parcels were
seized, and he was again arrested, early in January, 1544. He contrived
to escape to Piedmont; but, returning secretly after six months to
print documents of defence, he was discovered and sent to prison in
Paris. The last pardon having covered all previous writings, the
prosecutors sought in his translation of the pseudo-Platonic dialogues
<i>Axiochus</i> and <i>Hipparchus</i>, printed with his last
vindication; and, finding a slight over-emphasis of Sokrates&rsquo;s
phrase describing the death of the body (&ldquo;thou shalt no longer
be,&rdquo; rendered by &ldquo;thou shalt no longer be anything at
all&rdquo;), pronounced this a wilful propounding of a heresy, though
in fact there had been no denial of the doctrine of
immortality.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e21991src" href="#xd25e21991"
name="xd25e21991src">143</a> This time the prey was held. After Dolet
had been in prison for twenty months the Parlement of Paris ratified
the sentence of death; and he was burned alive on August 3, 1546. The
utter wickedness of the whole process<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e21997src" href="#xd25e21997" name="xd25e21997src">144</a> at
least serves to relieve by neighbourhood the darkness of the stains
cast on Protestantism by the crimes of Calvin. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span></p>
<p>The whole of the clerical opposition to the new learning at this
period is not unjustly to be characterized as a malignant cabal of
ignorance against knowledge. In Germany as in France real learning was
substantially on the side of the persecuted writers. When, in March of
1537, Dolet was entertained at a banquet to celebrate the pardon
granted to him by the king for his homicide at Lyons on the last day of
the previous year, there came to it, by Dolet&rsquo;s own account, the
chief lights of learning in France&mdash;Bud&eacute;, the chief Greek
scholar of his time; Berauld, his nearest compeer; Dan&egrave;s and
Toussain, both pupils of Bud&eacute; and the first royal professors of
Greek at Paris; Marot, &ldquo;the French Maro&rdquo;; Rabelais, then
regarded as a great new light in medicine; Voult&eacute;,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e22003src" href="#xd25e22003" name=
"xd25e22003src">145</a> and others. The men of enlightenment at first
instinctively drew together, recognizing that on all hands they were
surrounded by rabid enemies, who were the enemies of knowledge. But
soon the stresses of the time drove them asunder. Voult&eacute;, who in
this year was praising Rabelais in Latin epigrams, was attacking him in
the next as an impious disciple of Lucian;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22009src" href="#xd25e22009" name="xd25e22009src">146</a> and,
after having warmly befriended Dolet, was impeaching him, not without
cause, as an ingrate. It was an age of passion and violence; and
Voult&eacute; was himself assassinated in 1542 &ldquo;by a man who had
been unsuccessful in a law-suit against him.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e22012src" href="#xd25e22012" name="xd25e22012src">147</a></p>
<p>Infamous as was the cruelty with which Dolet was persecuted to the
death, his execution was but a drop in the sea of blood then being shed
in France by the Church. The king, sinking under his maladies, had
become the creature of the priests, who in defiance of the Chancellor
obtained his signature (1545) to a decree for a renewed persecution of
the heretics of the Vaudois; and an army, followed by a Catholic mob
and accompanied by the papal vice-legate of Avignon, burst upon the
doomed territory and commenced to burn and slay. Women captured were
violated and then thrown over precipices; and twice over, when a
multitude of fugitives in a fortified place surrendered on the
assurance that their lives and property would be spared, the commander
ordered that all should be put to death. When old soldiers refused to
enact such an infamy, others joyfully obeyed, the mob aiding; and among
the women were committed, as usual, &ldquo;all the crimes of which hell
could dream.&rdquo; Three towns were destroyed, 3,000 persons
massacred, 256 executed, six or seven hundred more sent to the galleys,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span>and many children sold as slaves.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e22019src" href="#xd25e22019" name=
"xd25e22019src">148</a> Thus was the faith vindicated and
safeguarded.</p>
<p>Of the freethought of such an age there could be no adequate record.
Its tempestuous energy, however, implies not a little of private
unbelief; and at a time when in England, two generations behind France
in point of literary evolution, there was, as we shall see, a measure
of rationalism among religionists, there must have been at least as
much in the land of Rabelais and Desperiers. The work of Guillaume
Postell, <i lang="la">De causis seu principiis et originibus
Natur&aelig; contra Atheos</i>, published in 1552, testifies to kinds
of unbelief that outwent the doubt of Rabelais; though Postell&rsquo;s
general extravagance discounts all of his utterances. It is said of
Guillaume Pellicier (1527&ndash;1568), Bishop of Montpellier, who first
turned Protestant and afterwards, according to Gui Patin, atheist, that
he would have been burned but for the fact of his
consecration.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22043src" href="#xd25e22043"
name="xd25e22043src">149</a> And the English chroniclers preserve a
scandal concerning an anonymous atheist, worded as follows:
&ldquo;1539. This yeare, in October, died in the Universitie of Parris,
in France, a great doctor, which said their was no God, and had bene of
that opinion synce he was twentie yeares old, and was above fouerscore
yeares olde when he died. And all that tyme had kept his error secrett,
and was esteamed for one of the greatest clarkes in all the Universitie
of Parris, and his sentence was taken and holden among the said
studentes as firme as scripture, which shewed, when he was asked why he
had not shewed his opinion till his death, he answered that for feare
of death he durst not, but when he knew that he should die he said
their was no lief to come after this lief, and so died miserably to his
great damnation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22065src" href=
"#xd25e22065" name="xd25e22065src">150</a></p>
<p>Among the eminent ones then surmised to lean somewhat to unbelief

the pagan fashion in which he handled Christian things scandalized his
own side, albeit he was hostile to Rabelais. But though the spirit of
the French Renaissance, so eagerly expressed in the <i lang=

six dialogues, in which seven men take part, setting forth the
different religious standpoints of Jew, Christian, pagan, Lutheran,
Calvinist, and Catholic, the whole leading up to a doctrine of
tolerance and universalism. Bodin was repeatedly and emphatically
accused of unbelief by friends and foes;<a class="noteref" id=

Nonetheless, he essentially stood for religious toleration: the new
principle that was to change the face of intellectual life. A few
liberal Catholics shared it with him to some extent<a class="noteref"

<p>Two years later there was put to death at Paris, by hanging and
burning, on the charge of atheism, Geoffroi Vall&eacute;e, a man of
good family in Orl&eacute;ans. Long before, at the age of sixteen, he
had written a freethinking treatise entitled <i lang="fr">La

and to his having translated into Latin (1562) the <i>Hypotyposes</i>
of Sextus Empiricus, a work which must have made for freethinking. But
he was rather a Protestant than a rationalist. In the former book he
had spoken, either sincerely or ironically, of the &ldquo;detestable
book&rdquo; of Bonaventure Desperiers, calling him a mocker of God; and
impeached Rabelais as a modern Lucian, believing neither in God nor
immortality;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22287src" href="#xd25e22287"

<p>One literary movement towards better things had begun before the
crowning infamy of the Massacre appalled men into questioning the creed
of intolerance. Castalio, whom we shall see driven from Geneva by
Calvin in 1544 for repugning to the doctrine of predestination,
published pseudonymously, in 1554, in reply to Calvin&rsquo;s
vindication of the slaying of Servetus, a tract, <i lang="la">De
Haereticis quomodo cum iis agendum sit variorum Sententi&aelig;</i>, in
which he contrived to collect some passage from the Fathers and from
modern writers in favour of toleration. To these he prefaced, by way of
a letter to the Duke of Wirtemberg, an argument of his own, the
starting-point of much subsequent propaganda.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22313src" href="#xd25e22313" name="xd25e22313src">173</a>
Aconzio, another Italian, followed in his steps; and later came Mino
Celso of Siena, with his &ldquo;long and elaborate argument against
persecution,&rdquo; <i lang="la">De Haereticis capitali supplicio non
afficiendis</i> (1584).<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22334src" href=
"#xd25e22334" name="xd25e22334src">174</a> Withal, Castalio died in
beggary, ostracized alike by Protestants and Catholics, and befriended
only by the Sozzini, whose sect was the first to earn collectively the
praise of condemning persecution.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22340src"
href="#xd25e22340" name="xd25e22340src">175</a> But in the next
generation there came to reinforce the cause of humanity a more
puissant pen than any of these; while at the same time the recoil from
religious cruelty was setting many men secretly at utter variance with
faith.</p>
<p>In France in particular a generation of insane civil war for
religion&rsquo;s sake must have gone far to build up unbelief. Even
among many who did not renounce the faith, there went on an open
evolution of stoicism, generated through resort to the teaching of
Epictetus. The atrocities of Christian civil war and Christian savagery
were such that Christian faith could give small sustenance to the more
thoughtful and sensitive men who had to face them and carry on the
tasks of public life the while. The needed strength was given by the
masculine discipline which pagan thought had provided for an age of
oppression and decadence, and which had carried so much of healing even
for the Christians who saw decadence carried yet further, that in the
fifth century the <i>Enchiridion</i> of Epictetus had been turned by
St. Nilus into a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393"
name="pb393">393</a>]</span>monastic manual, even as Ambrose
manipulated the borrowed Stoicism of Cicero.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22353src" href="#xd25e22353" name="xd25e22353src">176</a> With
its devout theism, the book had appealed to those northern scholars who
had mastered Greek in the early years of the sixteenth century, when
the refugees of Constantinople had set up Platonic studies in Italy.
After 1520, Italian Hellenism rapidly decayed;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22356src" href="#xd25e22356" name="xd25e22356src">177</a> but in
the north it never passed away; and from the stronger men of the new
learning in Germany the taste for Epictetus passed into France. In 1558
the semi-Protestant legist Coras&mdash;later slain in the massacre of
St. Bartholomew&mdash;published at Toulouse a translation of the
apocryphal dialogue of Epictetus and Hadrian; in 1566 the Protestant
poet Rivaudeau translated the <i>Enchiridion</i>, which thenceforth
became a culture force in France.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22363src"
href="#xd25e22363" name="xd25e22363src">178</a></p>
<p>The influence appears in Montaigne, in whose essays it is pervasive;
but more directly and formally in the book of Justus Lipsius, <i lang=
"la">De Constantia</i> (1584), and the same scholar&rsquo;s posthumous
dialogues entitled <i lang="la">Manducatio ad philosophiam
sto&iuml;cam</i> and <i lang="la">Physiologia sto&iuml;corum</i>
(1604), which influenced all scholarly Europe. Thus far the Stoic ethic
had been handled with Christian bias and application; and Guillaume Du
Vair, who embodied it in his work <i lang="fr">La Sainte
Philosophie</i> (1588), was not known as a heretic; but in his hands it
receives no Christian colouring, and might pass for the work of a
deist.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22386src" href="#xd25e22386" name=
"xd25e22386src">179</a> And its popularity is to be inferred from his
further production of a fresh translation of the <i>Enchiridion</i> and
a <i lang="fr">Trait&eacute; de la philosophie morale des
sto&iuml;ques</i>. Under Henri IV he rose to high power; and his public
credit recommended his doctrine.</p>
<p>Such were the more visible fruits of the late spread of the
Renaissance ferment in France while, torn by the frantic passions of
her pious Catholics, she passed from the plane of the Renaissance to
that of the new Europe, in which the intellectual centre of gravity was
to be shifted from the south to the north, albeit Italy was still to
lead the way, in Galileo, for the science of the modern world.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In England as in France the intellectual life
undergoes visible retrogression in the fifteenth century, while in
Italy, with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394"
name="pb394">394</a>]</span>political problem rapidly developing
towards catastrophe, it flourished almost riotously. From the age of
Chaucer, considered on its intellectual side and as represented mainly
by him, there is a steep fall to almost the time of Sir Thomas More,
around whom we see as it were the sudden inrush of the Renaissance upon
England. The conquest of France by Henry V and the Wars of the Roses,
between them, brought England to the nadir of mental and moral life.
But in the long and ruinous storm the Middle Ages, of which Wiclif is
the last powerful representative, were left behind, and a new age
begins to be prepared.</p>
<p>Of a very different type from Wiclif is the remarkable personality
of the Welshman <span class="sc">Reginald</span> (or <span class=
"sc">Reynold</span>) <span class="sc">Pecock</span>
(1395?&ndash;1460?), who seems divided from Wiclif by a whole era of
intellectual development, though born within about ten years of his
death. It is a singular fact that one of the most rationalistic minds
among the serious writers of the fifteenth century should be an English
bishop,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22421src" href="#xd25e22421" name=
"xd25e22421src">180</a> and an Ultramontane at that. Pecock was an
opponent at once of popular Bibliolatry and of priestly persecution,
declaring that &ldquo;the clergy would be condemned at the last day if
they did not draw men into consent to the true faith otherwise than by
fire and sword and hanging.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22427src"
href="#xd25e22427" name="xd25e22427src">181</a> It was as the rational
and temperate defender of the Church against the attacks of the
Lollards in general that he formulated the principle of natural reason
as against scripturalism. This attitude it is that makes his treatise,
the <i>Repressor of Overmuch Blaming of the Clergy</i>, the most modern
of theoretic books before More and Hooker and Bacon. That he was led to
this measure of rationalism rather by the exigencies of his papalism
than by a spontaneous skepticism is suggested by the fact that he
stands for the acceptance of miraculous images, shrines, and relics,
when the Lollards are attacking them.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22434src" href="#xd25e22434" name="xd25e22434src">182</a> On the
other hand, it is hard to be certain that his belief in the shrines was
genuine, so ill does it consist with his attitude to Bibliolatry. In a
series of serenely argued points he urges his thesis that the Bible is
not the basis of the moral law, but merely an illustration thereof, and
that the natural reason is obviously presupposed in the bulk of its
teaching. He starts from the formulas of Thomas Aquinas, but reaches a
higher ground. It is the position of Hooker, anticipated by a hundred
years; and this in an age of such intellectual backwardness and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>literary decadence that the earlier man must be
pronounced by far the more remarkable figure. In such a case the full
influence of the Renaissance seems to be at work; though in the
obscurity of the records we can do no more than conjecture that the new
contacts with French culture between the invasion of France by Henry V
in 1415 and the expulsion of the English in 1451 may have introduced
forces of thought unknown or little known before. If indeed there were
English opponents of scripture in Wiclif&rsquo;s day, the idea must
have ripened somewhat in Pecock&rsquo;s. Whether, however, the
victories of Jeanne D&rsquo;Arc made some unbelievers as well as many
dastards among the English is a problem that does not seem to have been
investigated.</p>
<p>Pecock&rsquo;s reply to the Lollards creates the curious situation
of a churchman rebutting heretics by being more profoundly heretical
than they. In his system, the Scriptures &ldquo;reveal&rdquo; only
supernatural truths not otherwise attainable, a way of safeguarding
dogma not likely to reassure believers. There is reason, indeed, to
suspect that Pecock held no dogma with much zeal; and when in his
well-named treatise (now lost), <i>The Provoker</i>, he denied the
authenticity of the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, &ldquo;he alienated every
section of theological opinion in England.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">See Miss A. M. Cooke&rsquo;s art. <span class=
"sc">Reginald Pecock</span> in <i>Dict. of Nat. Biog.</i> This valuable
notice is the best short account of Pecock; though the nature of his
case is most fully made out by Hook, as cited below. It is
characteristic of the restricted fashion in which history is still
treated that neither in the <i>Student&rsquo;s History</i> of Professor
Gardiner nor in the <i>Short History</i> of Green is Pecock mentioned.
Earlier ideas concerning him were far astray. The notion of Foxe, the
martyrologist, that Pecock was an early Protestant, is a gross error.
He held not a single Protestant tenet, being a rationalizing papist. A
German ecclesiastical historian of the eighteenth century (Werner,
<i lang="de">Kirchengeschichte des 18ten Jahrhunderts</i>, 1756, cited
by Lechler) calls Pecock the first English deist. See a general view of
his opinions in Lewis&rsquo;s <i>Life of Dr. Reynold Pecock</i> (rep.
1820), ch. v. The heresies charged on him are given on p. 160; also in
the R. T. S. <i>Writings and Examinations</i>, 1831, pp. 200&ndash;201.
While rejecting Bibliolatry, he yet argued that Popes and Councils
could make no change in the current creed; and he thus offended the
High Churchmen. Cp. Massingberd, <i>The English Reformation</i>, 4th
ed. pp. 206&ndash;209.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main causes of the hostility he met from the English hierarchy
and Government appear to have been, on the one hand, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>his
change of political party, which put him in opposition to Archbishop
Bourchier, and on the other his zealous championship of the authority
of the papacy as against that of the Councils of the Church. It was
expressly on the score of his denunciation of the Councils that he was
tried and condemned.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22480src" href=
"#xd25e22480" name="xd25e22480src">183</a> Thus the reward of his

"noteref" id="xd25e22486src" href="#xd25e22486" name=
"xd25e22486src">184</a> was his formal disgrace and virtual
imprisonment. Had he not recanted, he would have been burned: as it
was, his books were; and it is on record that they consisted of eleven
quartos and three folios of manuscript. Either because of his papalism
or as a result of official intrigue, Church and lords and commons were
of one mind against him; and the mob would fain have burned him with
his books.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22495src" href="#xd25e22495"
name="xd25e22495src">185</a> In that age of brutal strife, when
&ldquo;neither the Church nor the opponents of the Church had any
longer a sway over men&rsquo;s hearts,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22498src" href="#xd25e22498" name="xd25e22498src">186</a> he
figures beside the mindless prelates and their lay peers somewhat as
does More later beside Henry VIII, as Reason <i>versus</i> the Beast;
and it was illustrative of his entire lack of fanaticism that he made
the demanded retractations&mdash;avowing his sin in &ldquo;trusting to
natural reason&rdquo; rather than to Scripture and the authority of the
Church&mdash;and went his way in silence to solitude and death. The
ruling powers disposed of Lollardism in their own way; and in the Wars
of the Roses every species of heretical thought seems to disappear. The
bribe held out to the nation by the invasion of France had been fatally
effectual to corrupt the spirit of moral criticism which inspired the
Lollard movement at its best; and the subsequent period of rapine and
strife reduced thought and culture to the levels of the Middle
Ages.</p>
<p>A hint of what was possible in the direction of freethought in the
England of Henry V and Henry VI emerges in some of the records
concerning Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, the youngest son of Henry IV.
Gifted but ill-balanced, Humphrey was the chief patron of learning in
England in his day; and he drank deeply of the spirit of Renaissance
scholarship.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22515src" href="#xd25e22515"
name="xd25e22515src">187</a> Sir Thomas More preserves the
story&mdash;reproduced also in the old play, <i>The First Part of the
Contention of the two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster</i>&mdash;of
how he exposed the fraud of a begging impostor who pretended to have
recovered his sight through the virtue of a saint&rsquo;s relics; and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>a modern pietistic historian decides that the
Duke &ldquo;had long ceased to believe in miracles and
relics.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22526src" href="#xd25e22526"
name="xd25e22526src">188</a> But if this be true, it is the whole truth
as to Humphrey&rsquo;s freethinking. It was the highest flight of
rationalism permissible in his day and sphere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">On the view that Humphrey was a freethinker, the pious
Pauli, who says (as cited, p. 337) of the Renaissance of letters,
&ldquo;The weak and evil side of this revived form of literature is
that its disciples should have elevated the morality, or rather the
immorality, of classical antiquity above Christian discipline and
virtue,&rdquo; sees fit further to pronounce that the bad account of
Gloucester&rsquo;s condition of body drawn up eleven years before his
death by the physician Kymer is a proof of the &ldquo;wild unbridled
passions by which the duke was swayed,&rdquo; and throws a lurid light
upon &ldquo;the tendencies and disposition of his mind.&rdquo; Humphrey
lived till 55, and died suddenly, under circumstances highly suggestive
of poisoning by his enemies. His brothers Henry and John died much
younger than he; but in their case the religious historian sees no
ground for imputation. But the historian&rsquo;s inference is
overstrained. In reality Humphrey never indicated any lack of
theological faith. The poet Lydgate, no unbeliever, described him as
&ldquo;Chose of God to be his owne knyghte,&rdquo; and so rigorous
&ldquo;that heretike dar not comen in his sihte&rdquo; (verses
transcribed in Furnivall&rsquo;s <i>Early English Meals and
Manners</i>, 1868, pp. lxxxv&ndash;vi).</p>
<p>His most comprehensive biographer decides that he was
&ldquo;essentially orthodox,&rdquo; despite his uncanonical marriage
with his second wife and his general reputation for sexual laxity.
&ldquo;He was punctilious in the performance of his religious
duties&rdquo; and &ldquo;a stern opponent of the Lollards&rdquo;; he
&ldquo;countenanced the extinction of heresy by being present at the
burning at Smithfield of an old priest who denied the validity of the
sacraments of the Church&rdquo;; and an Archbishop of Milan pronounced
him to be &ldquo;known everywhere as the chiefest friend and preserver
of Holy Church&rdquo; (K. H. Vickers, <i>Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester:
A Biography</i>, 1907, pp. 223, 321&ndash;23). Of such a personage no
exegesis can make a rationalist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of other traces of critical thinking in England in that age there is
little to be said, so little literature is there to convey them. But
there are signs of the influence of the &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; thought of
the Renaissance in religious books. The old <i>Revelation of the Monk
of Evesham</i>, ostensibly dating from 1196, was first printed about
1482,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22546src" href="#xd25e22546" name=
"xd25e22546src">189</a> with a &ldquo;prologe&rdquo; explaining that it
&ldquo;was not shewed to hym only for hym butte also for the confort

resons and mocyons of infydelite the which risith often tymes of

Evidently the old problem of immortality had been agitated.</p>

<p class="first">Not till late in the fifteenth century is the
intellectual side of the Renaissance influence to be seen bearing fruit
in Germany, of which the turbulent and semi-barbaric life in the
medieval period was little favourable to mental progress. Of political
hostility to the Church there was indeed an abundance, long before
Luther;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22558src" href="#xd25e22558" name=
"xd25e22558src">190</a> but amid the many traces of
&ldquo;irreligion&rdquo; there is practically none of rational
freethinking. What reasoned thought there was, as we have seen, turned
to Christian mysticism of a pantheistic cast, as in the teaching of
Tauler and Eckhart.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22567src" href=
"#xd25e22567" name="xd25e22567src">191</a></p>
<p>Another and a deeper current of thought is seen in the remarkable
philosophic work of Bishop Nicolaus of Kues or Cusa (1401&ndash;1464),
who, professedly by an independent movement of reflection, but really
as a result of study of Greek philosophy, reached a larger pantheism
than had been formulated by any Churchman since the time of John the
Scot.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22572src" href="#xd25e22572" name=
"xd25e22572src">192</a> There is little or no trace, however, of any
influence attained by his teaching, which indeed could appeal only to a
very few minds of that day. Less remarkable than the metaphysic of
Nicolaus, though also noteworthy in its way, is his <i>Dialogue</i>
&ldquo;On Peace, or Concordance of Faith,&rdquo; in which, somewhat in
the spirit of Boccaccio&rsquo;s tale of the Three Kings, he aims at a
reconciliation of all religions, albeit by way of proving the Christian
creed to be the true one.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands and other parts of western Europe the popular
anti-ecclesiastical heresy of the thirteenth century spread in various
degrees; but there is only exceptional trace of literate or properly
rationalistic freethinking. Among the most notable developments was the
movement in Holland early in the fourteenth century, which compares
closely with that of the higher Paulicians and mystics of the two
previous centuries, its chief traits being <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span>a
general pantheism, a denial of the efficacy of the sacrament of the
altar, an insistence that all men are sons of God, and a general
declaration for &ldquo;natural light.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22588src" href="#xd25e22588" name="xd25e22588src">193</a> But
this did not progressively develop. Lack of leisured culture in the Low
Countries, and the terrorism of the Inquisition, would sufficiently
account for the absence of avowed unbelief, though everywhere,
probably, some was set up by the contact of travellers with the culture
of Italy. It is fairly to be inferred that in a number of cases the
murderous crusade against witchcraft which was carried on in the
fifteenth century served as a means of suppressing heresy,
rationalistic or other. At Arras, for instance, in 1460, the execution
of a number of leading citizens on a charge of sorcery seems to have
been a blow at free discussion in the &ldquo;chambers of
rhetoric.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22594src" href=
"#xd25e22594" name="xd25e22594src">194</a> And that rationalism,
despite such frightful catastrophes, obscurely persisted, is to be
gathered from the long vogue of the work of the Spanish physician
Raymund of Sebonde,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22600src" href=
"#xd25e22600" name="xd25e22600src">195</a> who, having taught
philosophy at Toulouse, undertook (about 1435) to establish
Christianity on a rational foundation<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22606src" href="#xd25e22606" name="xd25e22606src">196</a> in his
<i lang="la">Theologia Naturalis</i>, made famous later by
Montaigne.</p>
<p>To what length the suppressed rationalism of the age could on
occasion go is dramatically revealed in the case of <span class=
"sc">Hermann van Ryswyck</span>, a Dutch priest, burned for heresy at
the Hague in 1512. He was not only a priest in holy orders, but one of
the order of Inquisitors; and he put forth the most impassioned denial
and defiance of the Christian creed of which there is any record down
to modern times. Tried before the inquisitors in 1502, he declared
&ldquo;with his own mouth and with sane mind&rdquo; that the world is
eternal, and was not created as was alleged by &ldquo;the fool
Moses&rdquo; that there is no hell, and no future life; that Christ,
whose whole career was flatly contrary to human welfare and reason, was
not the son of Omnipotent God, but a fool, a dreamer, and a seducer of
ignorant men, of whom untold numbers had been slain on account of him
and his absurd evangel; that Moses had not physically received the law
from God; and that &ldquo;our&rdquo; faith was shown to be fabulous by
its fatuous Scripture, fictitious Bible, and crazy Gospel. And to this
exasperated testimony he added: &ldquo;I was born a Christian, but am
no longer one: they are the chief fools.&rdquo; Sentenced in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>1502 to perpetual imprisonment, he was again
brought forward ten years later, and, being found unbroken by that long
durance, was as an unrepentant heretic sentenced to be burned on
December 14, 1512, the doom being carried out on the same day. The
source of his conviction can be gathered from his declaration that
&ldquo;the most learned Aristotle and his commentator Averro&euml;s
were nearest the truth&rdquo;; but his wild sincerity and unyielding
courage were all his own. &ldquo;<span lang="la">Nimis infelix
quidam</span>&rdquo; is the estimate of an inquisitor of that
day.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22631src" href="#xd25e22631" name=
"xd25e22631src">197</a> Not so, unless they are most unhappy who die in
battle, fighting for the truth they prize. But it has always been the
Christian way to contemn all save Christian martyrs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">There is a tolerably full account of Ryswyck&rsquo;s
case in a nearly contemporary document, which evidently copies the
official record. Ryswyck is described as &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">sacr&#275; theologi&#275; professorem ordinis predicatorum et
inquisitorum</span>&rdquo;; and his declaration runs:
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Quod mundum fuit ab eterna et non incipit per

<p>Thus the Renaissance passed on to the age of the Reformation the
seeds of a rationalism which struck far deeper than the doctrine of
Luther, but at the same time left a social soil in which such seeds
could ill grow. Its own defeat, social and intellectual, may be best
realized in terms of its failure to reach either political or physical
science. Lack of the former meant political retrogression and bondage;
and lack of the latter a renewed dominion of superstition and
Bibliolatry&mdash;two sets of conditions of which each facilitated the
other. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nothing is more significant of the intellectual climate of the
Renaissance than the persistence at all its stages of the belief in
astrology, of which we find some dregs even in Bacon. That
pseudo-science indeed stands, after all, for the spirit of science, and
is not to be diagnosed as mere superstition; being really an &agrave;
priori fallacy fallen into in the deliberate search for some principle
of co&ouml;rdination in human affairs. Though adhered to by many
prominent Catholics, including Charles V, and by many Protestants,
including Melanchthon, it is logically anti-Christian, inasmuch as it
presupposes in the moral world a reign of natural law, independent of
the will or caprice of any personal power. Herein it differs deeply
from magic;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22652src" href="#xd25e22652"
name="xd25e22652src">198</a> though in the Renaissance the return to
the lore of antiquity often involved an indiscriminate acceptance and
blending of both sorts of occult pagan lore.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22658src" href="#xd25e22658" name="xd25e22658src">199</a> Magic
subordinates Nature to Will: astrology, as apart from angelology,
subordinates Will to Cosmic Law. For many perplexed and thoughtful men,
accordingly, it was a substitute, more or less satisfying, for the
theory, grown to them untenable, of a moral government of the universe.
It was in fact a primary form of sociology proper, as it had been the
primary form of astronomy; to which latter science, even in the
Renaissance, it was still for many the introduction.</p>
<p>It flourished, above all things, on the insecurity inseparable from
the turbulent Italian life of the Renaissance, even as it had
flourished on the appalling vicissitude of the drama of imperial Rome;
and it is conceivable that the inclination to true science which is
seen in such men as Galileo, after the period of Italian independence,
was nourished by the greater stability attained for a time under
absolutist rule. And though Protestantism, on the other hand, adhered
in the main unreasoningly to the theory of a moral control, that dogma
at least served to countervail the dominion of astrology, which was
only a dogmatism with a difference, and as such inevitably hindered
true science.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22666src" href="#xd25e22666"
name="xd25e22666src">200</a> On the whole, Protestantism tended to make
more effectual that veto on pagan occultism which had been
ineffectually passed from time to time by the Catholic Church; albeit
the motive was stress of Christian superstition, and the veto was aimed
almost as readily at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402"
name="pb402">402</a>]</span>inductive and true science as at the
deductive and false. We shall find the craze of witchcraft, in turn,
dominating Protestant countries at a time when freethinkers and liberal
Catholics elsewhere were setting it at naught.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that, broadly speaking, the new interest
in Scripture study and ecclesiastical history told against the free
play of thought on scientific and scholarly problems; we shall find
Bacon realizing the fact a hundred years after Luther&rsquo;s start;
and the influence has operated down to our own day. In this resistance
Catholics played their part. The famous Cornelius Agrippa<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e22679src" href="#xd25e22679" name=
"xd25e22679src">201</a> (1486&ndash;1535) never ceased to profess
himself a Catholic, and had small sympathy with the Reformers, though
always at odds with the monks; and his long popular treatise <i lang=
"la">De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum et artium, atque
excellentia verbi Dei declamatio</i> (1531) is a mere polemic for
scripturalism against alike false science and true, monkish
superstition and reason. Vilified as a magician by the monks, and as an
atheist and a scoffer by angry humanists,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22685src" href="#xd25e22685" name="xd25e22685src">202</a> he did
but set error against error, being himself a believer in witchcraft, a
hater of anatomy, and as confident in his contempt of astronomy as of
astrology. And his was a common frame of mind for centuries.</p>
<p>Still, the new order contained certain elements of help for a new
life, as against its own inclement principles of authority and dogma;
and the political heterogeneity of Europe, seconded by economic
pressures and by new geographic discovery, sufficed further to prevent
any far-reaching organization of tyranny. Under these conditions, new
knowledge could incubate new criticism. But it would be an
error-breeding oversight to forget that in the many-coloured world
before the Reformation there was not only a certain artistic and
imaginative sunlight which the Reformation long darkened, but even,
athwart the mortal rigours of papal rule, a certain fitful play of
intellectual insight to which the peoples of the Reformation became for
a time estranged. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403"

statement, but notes that in Ciatti&rsquo;s MS. annals of Perugia, ad

Buckle (3-vol. ed. ii, 10; 1-vol. ed. p. 291) errs in representing
L&rsquo;Hopital as the only statesman of the time who dreamt of
toleration. It is to be noted, on the other hand, that the Huguenots
themselves protested against any toleration of atheists or Anabaptists;
and even the reputed freethinker Gabriel Naud&eacute;, writing his

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a vague and general sense the ecclesiastical
revolution known as the Reformation was a phenomenon of freethought. To
be so understood, indeed, it must be regarded in contrast to the
dominion of the Catholic Church, not to the movement which we call the
Renaissance. That movement it was that made the Reformation possible;
and if we have regard to the reign of Bibliolatry which Protestantism
set up, we seem to be contemplating rather a superimposing of Semitic
darkness upon Hellenic light than an intellectual emancipation.
Emancipation of another kind the Reformation doubtless brought about.
In particular it involved, to an extent not generally realized, a
secularization of life, through the sheer curtailment, in most
Protestant countries, of the personnel and apparatus of clericalism,
and the new disrepute into which, for a time, these fell. Alike in
Germany and in England there was a breaking-up of habits of reverence
and of self-prostration before creed and dogma and ritual. But this
liberation was rather social than intellectual, and the product was
rather licence and irreverence than ordered freethought. On the other
hand, when the first unsettlement was over, the new growth of
Bibliolatry tended rather to deepen the religious way of feeling and
make more definite the religious attitude. Tolerance did not emerge
until after a whole era of embittered strife. The Reformation, in fact,
was much more akin to a revolt against a hereditary king than to the
process of self-examination and logical scrutiny by which men pass from
belief to disbelief in a theory of things, a dogma, or a document.</p>
<p>The beginning of such a process had indeed taken place in Germany
before Luther, insofar as the New Learning represented by such
humanists as Erasmus, such scholars as Reuchlin,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22707src" href="#xd25e22707" name="xd25e22707src">1</a> and such
satirists as Ulrich von Hutten, set up a current of educated hostility
to the ignorance and the grosser superstitions of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>churchmen. For Germany, as for England, this
movement was a contagion from the new scholarship and Platonism of
Italy;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22715src" href="#xd25e22715" name=
"xd25e22715src">2</a> and the better minds in the four universities
founded in the pre-Lutheran generation (T&uuml;bingen, 1477; Mayence,
1482; Frankfort-on-the-Oder, 1506; Wittemberg, 1502) necessarily owed
much to Italian impulses, which they carried on, though the
universities as a whole were bitterly hostile to the new
learning.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22729src" href="#xd25e22729" name=
"xd25e22729src">3</a> The Dutch freethinker Ryswyck, as we saw, was
fundamentally an Averro&iuml;st; and Italy was the stronghold of
Averro&iuml;sm, of which the monistic bias probably fostered the
Unitarianism of the sixteenth century. But it was not this literary and
scholarly movement that effected the Reformation so-called, which was
rather an economic and political than a mental revolution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The persistence of Protestant writers in discussing
the early history of the Reformation without a glance at the economic
causation is one of the great hindrances to historic science. From such
popular works as those of D&rsquo;Aubign&eacute; and H&auml;usser it is
practically impossible to learn what socially took place in Germany;
and the general Protestant reader can learn it only&mdash;and
imperfectly&mdash;from the works on the Catholic side, as Audin&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr">Histoire de la vie de Luther</i> (Eng. tr. 1853) and
D&ouml;llinger&rsquo;s <i lang="de">Die Reformation</i>, and the more
scientific Protestant studies, such as those of Ranke and <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e22744" title="Source: Rezold">Bezold</span> (even there
not at any great length), to neither of which classes of history will
he resort. In England the facts are partially realized, in the light of
an ecclesiastical predilection, through High Church histories such as
that of Blunt, which proceed upon a Catholic leaning. Cobbett&rsquo;s
intemperate exposure of the economic causation has found an audience
chiefly among Catholics.</p>
<p>Bezold admits that &ldquo;with perfect justice have recent
historians commented on the former underrating of an economic force
which certainly played its part in the spread and establishment of the
Reformation&rdquo; (<i lang="de">Gesch. der deutschen Reformation</i>,
1890, p. 563). The broad fact is that in not a single country could the
Reformation have been accomplished without enlisting the powerful
classes or corporations, or alternatively the <i lang="la">de facto</i>
governments, by proffering the plunder of the Church. Only in a few
Swiss cantons, and in Holland, does the confiscation seem to have been
made to the common good (cp. the present writer&rsquo;s <i>Evolution of
States</i>, pp. 311, 343). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href=
"#pb405" name="pb405">405</a>]</span>But even in Holland needy nobles
had finally turned Protestant in the hope of getting Church lands. (See
Motley, <i>Rise of the Dutch Republic</i>, ed. 1863, p. 131.) Elsewhere
appropriation of Church lands by princes and nobles was the general
rule.</p>
<p>Even as to Germany, it is impossible to accept Michelet&rsquo;s
indulgent statement that most of the confiscated Church property
&ldquo;returned to its true destination, to the schools, the hospitals,
the communes; to its true proprietors, the aged, the child, the toiling
family&rdquo; (<i lang="fr">Hist. de France</i>, x, 333; see the same
assertion in Henderson, <i>Short History of Germany</i>, 1902, i, 344).
Plans to that effect were drawn up; but, as the princes were left to
carry out the arrangement, they took the lion&rsquo;s share. Ranke
(<i>Hist. of the Ref.</i> bk. iv, ch. v; Eng. tr. 1-vol. ed. 1905, pp.
466&ndash;67) admits much grabbing of Church lands as early as 1526;
merely contending, with Luther, that papist nobles had begun the
spoliation. (Cp. Bezold, pp. 564&ndash;65; Menzel, <i lang="de">Gesch.
der Deutschen</i>, cap. 393.) In Saxony, when monks broke away from
their monasteries, the nobles at once appropriated the lands and
buildings (Ranke, p. 467). Luther made a warm appeal to the Elector
against the nobles in general (Ranke, p. 467; Luther&rsquo;s letter,
Nov. 22, 1526, in <i lang="de">Werke</i>, ed. De Wette, iii, 137;
letter to Spalatin, Jan. 1, 1527, <i>id.</i> p. 147; also p. 153). See
too his indignant protests against the rapine of the princes and nobles
and the starvation of the ministers in the <i>Table Talk</i>, chs. 22,
60. Even Philip of Hesse did not adhere to his early and disinterested
plans of appropriation (Ranke, pp. 468&ndash;69, 711&ndash;12). All
that Ranke can claim is that &ldquo;<i>some</i> great institutions were
really founded&rdquo;&mdash;to wit, two homes for &ldquo;young ladies
of noble birth,&rdquo; four hospitals, and the theological school of
Marburg. And this was in the most hopeful region.</p>
<p>There is positive evidence, further, that not only ecclesiastical
but purely charitable foundations were plundered by the Protestants
(Witzel, cited by D&ouml;llinger, <i lang="de">Die Reformation, ihre
innere Entwickelung und ihre Wirkungen</i>, 1846, i, 46, 47, 51, 62);
and, as school foundations were confiscated equally with ecclesiastical
in England, there is no reason to doubt the statement. Practically the
same process took place in Scotland, where the share of Church property
proposed to be allotted to the Protestant ministers was never given,
and their protests were treated with contempt (Burton, <i>History of
Scotland</i>, iv, 37&ndash;41). Knox&rsquo;s comments were similar to
Luther&rsquo;s (<i>Works</i>, Laing&rsquo;s ed. ii, 310&ndash;12).</p>
<p>Dr. Gardiner, a fairly impartial historian, sums up that, after the
German settlement of 1552, &ldquo;The princes claimed the right of
continuing to secularize Church lands within their territories as
inseparable from their general right of providing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span>for
the religion of their subjects&#8202;&hellip;. About a hundred
monasteries are said to have fallen victims in the Palatinate alone;
and an almost equal number, the gleanings of a richer harvest which had
been reaped before the Convention of Passau, were taken possession of
in Northern Germany&rdquo; (<i>The Thirty Years&rsquo; War</i>, 8th ed.
p. 11).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The credit of bringing the various forces to a head, doubtless,
remains with Luther, though ground was further prepared by literary
predecessors such as John of Wesel and John Wessel, Erasmus, Reuchlin,
and Ulrich von Hutten. But even the signal courage of Luther could not
have availed to fire an effectual train of action unless a certain
number of nobles had been ready to support him for economic reasons.
Even the shameless sale of indulgences by Tetzel was resented most
keenly on the score that it was draining Germany of money;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e22811src" href="#xd25e22811" name=
"xd25e22811src">4</a> and nothing is more certain than that Luther
began his battle not as a heretic but as an orthodox Catholic Reformer,
desiring to propitiate and not to defy the papacy. Economic forces were
the determinants. This becomes the more clear when we note that the
Reformation was only the culmination or explosion of certain
intellectual, social, and political forces seen at work throughout
Christendom for centuries before. In point of mere doctrine, the
Protestants of the sixteenth century had been preceded and even
distanced by heretics of the eleventh, and by teachers of the ninth.
The absurdity of relic-worship, the folly of pilgrimages and fastings,
the falsehood of the doctrine of transubstantiation, the heresy of
prayers to the saints, the unscripturalness of the
hierarchy&mdash;these and a dozen other points of protest had been
raised by Paulicians, by Paterini, by Beghards, by Apostolicals, by
Lollards, long before the time of Luther. As regards his nearer
predecessors, indeed, this is now a matter of accepted Protestant
history.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22817src" href="#xd25e22817" name=
"xd25e22817src">5</a> What is not properly realized is that the
conditions which wrought political success where before there had been
political failure were special political conditions; and that to these,
and not to supposed differences in national character, is due the
geographical course of the Reformation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have seen that the spirit of reform was strong in
Italy three hundred years before Luther; and that some of the strongest
movements within the Church were strictly reformatory, and originally
disinterested in a high degree. In less religious forms the same spirit
abounded throughout the Renaissance; and at the end of the fifteenth
century Savonarola was preaching reform religiously enough at Florence.
His death, however, was substantially due to the perception that
ecclesiastical reform, as conducted by him, was a socio-political
process,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22835src" href="#xd25e22835" name=
"xd25e22835src">6</a> whence the reformer was a socio-political
disturber. Intellectually he was no innovator; on the contrary, he was
a hater of literary enlightenment, and he was as ready to burn
astrologers as were his enemies to burn him.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22841src" href="#xd25e22841" name="xd25e22841src">7</a> His
claim, in his <i>Triumph of the Cross</i>, to combat unbelievers by
means of sheer natural reason, indicates only his inability to realize
any rationalist position&mdash;a failure to be expected in his age,
when rationalism was denied argumentative utterance, and when the
problems of Christian evidences were only being broached. The very form
of the book is declamatory rather than ratiocinative, and every
question raised is begged.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22850src" href=
"#xd25e22850" name="xd25e22850src">8</a> That he failed in his crusade
of Church reform, and that Luther succeeded in his, was due to no
difference between Italian and German character, but to the vast
difference in the political potentialities of the two cases. The fall
of public liberty in Florence, which must have been preceded as it was
accompanied by a relative decline in popular culture,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e22856src" href="#xd25e22856" name="xd25e22856src">9</a> and
which led to the failure of Savonarola, may be in a sense attributed to
Italian character; but that character was itself the product of
peculiar social and political conditions, and was not inferior to that
of any northern population.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22863src" href=
"#xd25e22863" name="xd25e22863src">10</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The Savonarolan movement had all the main features of
the Puritanism of the northern &ldquo;Reform.&rdquo; Savonarola sent
organized bodies of boys, latterly accompanied by bodies of adults, to
force their way into private houses and confiscate things thought
suitable for the reformatory bonfire. Burckhardt, p. 477; Perrens,
<i>J&eacute;rome Savonarole</i>, 2e &eacute;dit. pp. 140&ndash;41. The
things burned included pictures and busts of inestimable artistic
value, and manuscripts of exquisite beauty. Perrens, p. 229. Compare
Villari, as cited; George Eliot&rsquo;s <i>Romola</i>, bk. iii,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=

Forerunner</i> (Eng. tr.), bk. vii. Previous reformers had set up
&ldquo;bonfires of false hair and books against the faith&rdquo;
(Armstrong, as cited, p. 167); and Savonarola&rsquo;s bands of urchins
were developments from previous organizations, bent chiefly on
blackmail. (<i>Id.</i>) But he carried the tyranny furthest, and
actually proposed to put obstinate gamblers to the torture. Perrens, p.
132. Villari in his sentimental commemoration lecture on Savonarola
(<i>Studies Historical and Critical</i>, Eng. tr. 1907) ignores these
facts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When, a generation later, the propaganda of the Lutheran movement
reached Italy, it was more eagerly welcomed than in any of the Teutonic
countries outside of the first Lutheran circle, though a vigilant
system was at once set on foot for the destruction of the imported
books.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22890src" href="#xd25e22890" name=
"xd25e22890src">11</a> It had made much headway at Milan and Florence

himself that before 1530 the Lutheran heresy was widely spread not only
among the laity but among priests and friars, both mendicant and
non-mendicant, many of whom propagated it by their sermons.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e22901src" href="#xd25e22901" name=

number increased all over Italy. In 1541&ndash;45 they were numerous
and audacious at Bologna,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22918src" href=
"#xd25e22918" name="xd25e22918src">15</a> where in 1537 a commission of
cardinals and prelates, appointed by Pope Paul III, had reported
strongly on the need for reformation in the Church. In 1542 they were
so strong at Venice as to contemplate holding public assemblies; in the
neighbouring towns of Vicentino, Vicenza, and Trevisano they seem to
have been still more numerous;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22922src"
href="#xd25e22922" name="xd25e22922src">16</a> and Cardinal Caraffa
reported to the Pope that all Italy was infected with the
heresy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22927src" href="#xd25e22927" name=
"xd25e22927src">17</a></p>
<p>Now began the check. Among the Protestants themselves there had gone
on the inevitable strifes over the questions of the Trinity and the
Eucharist; the more rational views of Zwingli and Servetus were in
notable favour;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e22934src" href="#xd25e22934"
name="xd25e22934src">18</a> and the Catholic reaction, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>fanned by Caraffa, was the more facile. Measures
were first taken against heretical priests and monks; Ochino and Peter
Martyr had to fly; and many monks in the monastery of the latter were
imprisoned. At Rome was founded, in 1543, the Congregation of the Holy
Office, a new Inquisition, on the deadly model of that of Spain; and
thenceforth the history of Protestantism in Italy is but one of
suppression. The hostile force was all-pervading, organized, and
usually armed with the whole secular power; and though in Naples the
old detestation of the Inquisition broke out anew so strongly that even
the Spanish tyranny could not establish it,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e22956src" href="#xd25e22956" name="xd25e22956src">19</a> the
papacy elsewhere carried its point by explaining how much more lenient
was the Italian than the Spanish Inquisition. Such a pressure, kept up
by the strongest economic interest in Italy, no movement could resist;
and it would have suppressed the Reformation in any country or any
race, as a similar pressure did in Spain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Prof. Gebhart (<i lang="fr">Orig. de la Renais. en
Italie</i>, p. 68) writes that &ldquo;Italy has known no great national
heresies: one sees there no uprising of minds which resembles the
profound popular movements provoked by Waldo, Wiclif, John Huss, or
Luther.&rdquo; The decisive answer to this is soon given by the author
himself (p. 74): &ldquo;If the Order of Franciscans has had in the
peninsula an astonishing popularity; if it has, so to speak, formed a
Church within the Church, it is that it responded to the profound
aspirations of an entire people.&rdquo; (Cp. p. 77.) Yet again, after
telling how the Franciscan heresy of the <i>Eternal Gospel</i> so long
prevailed, M. Gebhart speaks (p. 78) of the Italians as a people whom
&ldquo;formal heresy has never seduced.&rdquo; These inconsistencies
derive from the old fallacy of attributing the course of the
Reformation to national character. (See it discussed in the present
writer&rsquo;s <i>Evolution of States</i>, pp. 237&ndash;38,
302&ndash;307, 341&ndash;44.) Burckhardt, while recognizing&mdash;as
against the theory of &ldquo;something lacking in the Italian
mind&rdquo;&mdash;that the Italian movements of Church reformation
&ldquo;failed to achieve success only because circumstances were
against them,&rdquo; goes on to object that the course of &ldquo;mighty
events like the Reformation &hellip; eludes the deductions of the
philosophers,&rdquo; and falls back on &ldquo;mystery.&rdquo;
(<i>Renaissance in Italy</i>, Eng. tr. p. 457.) There is really much
less &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; about such movements than about small ones;
and the causes of the Reformation are in large part obvious and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span>simple. Baur, even in the act of claiming
special credit for the personality of Luther as the great factor in the
Reformation, admits that only in the peculiar political conditions in
which he found himself could he have succeeded. (<i lang=
"de">Kirchengeschichte der neueren Zeit</i>, 1863, p. 23.)</p>
<p>The broad explanation of the Italian failure is that in Italy reform
could not for a moment be dreamt of save as <i>within</i> the Church,
where there was no economic leverage such as effected the Reformation
from the outside elsewhere. It was a relatively easy matter in Germany
and England to renounce the Pope&rsquo;s control and make the Churches
national or autonomous. To attempt that in Italy would have meant
creating a state of universal and insoluble strife. (Symonds,
<i>Renaissance in Italy</i>, vol. i, ed. 1897, p. 369. Symonds,
however, omits to note the <i>financial</i> dependence of Italian
society on the papal system; and his verdict that <i>Luther and the
nations of the north</i> saw clearly &ldquo;what the Italians could not
see&rdquo; is simply the racial fallacy over again.)</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Italians, as we have seen, were as much bent on
reformation as any other people in mass; and the earlier Franciscan
movement was obviously more disinterested than either the later German
or the English, in both of which plunder was the inducement to the
leading adherents, as it was also in Switzerland. There the wholesale
bestowal of Church livings on Italians was the strongest motive to
ecclesiastical revolution; and in Z&uuml;rich, the first canton which
adopted the Reformation, the process was made easy by the State
guaranteeing posts and pensions for life to the whole twenty-four
canons of the chapter. (Vieusseux, <i>History of Switzerland</i>, 1840,
pp. 120, 128; cp. Zschokke, <i lang="de">Schweizerland&rsquo;s
Geschichte</i>, 9te Ausg. ch. 32, and Jackson, <i>Huldreich
Zwingli</i>, 1901, pp. 222&ndash;25, 295&ndash;96.) The Protestants had
further the support of the unbelieving soldiery, made anti-religious in
the Italian wars, who rejoiced in the process of priest-baiting and
plunder (Vieusseux, p. 130).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process of suppression in Italy was prolonged through sixty
years. In 1543 numbers of Protestants began to fly; hundreds more were
cast into prison; and, save in a few places, public profession of the
heresy was suppressed. In 1546 the papacy persuaded the Venetian senate
to put down the Protestant communities in their dominions, and in 1548
there began in Venice a persecution in which many were sent to the
galleys. To reach secret Protestantism, the papacy dispersed spies
throughout Italy, Ferrara being particularly attended to, as a known
hotbed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23011src" href="#xd25e23011" name=

merciful Paul III (1550), Julius III authorized new severities. A
Ferrarese preacher was put to death; and the Duchess Ren&eacute;e, the
daughter of Louis XII, who had notoriously favoured the heretics, was
made virtually a prisoner in her own palace, secluded from her
children. At Faenza, a nobleman died under torture at the hands of the
inquisitors, and a mob in turn killed some of these;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e23019src" href="#xd25e23019" name="xd25e23019src">21</a> but
the main process went on throughout the country. An old Waldensian
community in Calabria having reverted to its former opinions under the
new stimulus, it was warred upon by the inquisitors, who employed for
the purpose outlaws; and multitudes of victims, including sixty women,
were put to the torture.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23022src" href=
"#xd25e23022" name="xd25e23022src">22</a> At Montalto, in 1560, another
Waldensian community were taken captive; eighty-eight men were
slaughtered, their throats being cut one by one; many more were
tortured; the majority of the men were sent to the Spanish galleys; and
the women and children were sold into slavery.<a class="noteref" id=

official record to have recommended his soul to God, the Virgin Mary,
St. Francis, and St. Anthony of Padua, though he had been condemned as
an obstinate Lutheran. The next victims (1556) are the Milanese friar
Ambrogio de Cavoli, who dies &ldquo;firm in his false opinion,&rdquo;

<p>The <i>Index</i>, anticipated by Charles V in the Netherlands
several years earlier, was established especially to resist the
Reformation; and its third class contained a prohibition of all
anonymous books <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413"
name="pb413">413</a>]</span>published since 1519. The destruction of
books in Italy in the first twenty years of the work of the
Congregation of the Index was enormous, nearly every library being
decimated, and many annihilated. All editions of the classics, and even
of the Fathers, annotated by Protestants, or by Erasmus, were
destroyed; the library of the Medicean College at Florence, despite the
appeals of Duke Cosmo, was denuded of many works of past generations,
now pronounced heretical; and many dead writers who had passed for good
Catholics were put on the <i>Index</i>. Booksellers, plundered of their
stocks, were fain to seek another calling; and printers, seeing that
any one of them who printed a condemned work had every book printed by
him put on the <i>Index</i>, were driven to refuse all save works
officially accredited. It was considered a merciful relaxation of the
procedure when, after the death of Paul IV (1555), certain books, such
as Erasmus&rsquo;s editions of the Fathers, were allowed to be merely
mutilated.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23125src" href="#xd25e23125"
name="xd25e23125src">38</a> The effect of the whole machinery in making
Italy in the seventeenth century relatively unlearned and illiterate
cannot easily be overstated.</p>
<p>In fine, the Reformation failed in Italy because of the <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e23130" title="Source: ecomonic">economic</span> and
political conditions, as it failed in Spain; as it failed in a large
part of Germany; as it would have failed in Holland had Philip II made
his capital there (in which case Spain might very well have become
Protestant); and as it would have failed in England had Elizabeth been
a Catholic, like her sister. During the sixty years from 1520 to 1580,
thousands of Italian Protestants left Italy, as thousands of Spanish
Protestants fled from Spain, and thousands of English Protestants from
England in the reign of Mary.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23133src"
href="#xd25e23133" name="xd25e23133src">39</a> To make the outcome in
Italy and Spain a basis for a theory of racial tendency in religion, or
racial defect of &ldquo;public spirit,&rdquo; is to explain history in
a fashion which, in physical science, has long been discredited as an
argument in a circle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">McCrie, at the old standpoint, says of the Inquisition
that &ldquo;this iniquitous and bloody tribunal could never obtain a
footing either in France or in Germany&rdquo;; that &ldquo;the attempt
to introduce it in the Netherlands was resisted by the adherents of the
old as well as the disciples of the new religion; and it kindled a
civil war which &hellip; issued in establishing civil and religious
liberty&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;the ease with which it was introduced
into Italy showed that, whatever illumination there was among the
Italians &hellip; they were destitute of that public <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span>spirit and energy of principle which were
requisite to shake off the degrading yoke by which they were
oppressed.&rdquo; The ethical attitude of the Christian historian is
noteworthy; but we are here concerned with his historiography. A little
reflection will make it clear that the non-establishment of the
Inquisition in France and Germany was due precisely to the fact that
the papacy was not <i>in</i> these countries as it was in Italy, and
that the native Governments resented external influence.</p>
<p>As to the Netherlands, the statement is misleading in the extreme.
The Inquisition set up by Charles V was long and fully established in
the Low Countries; and Motley recognizes that it was there more severe
even than in Spain. It was Charles V who, in 1546, gave orders for the
establishment of the Inquisition in Naples, when the people so
effectually resisted. The view, finally, that the attempt to suppress
heresy caused the Dutch revolt is merely part of the mythology of the
Reformation. Charles V, at the outset of his reign, stood to Spain in
the relation of a foreign king who, with his Flemish courtiers,
exploited Spanish revenues. Only by making Madrid his capital and
turning semi-Spanish did he at all reverse that relation between the
two parts of his dominions. So late as 1550 he set up an exceptionally
merciless form of the Inquisition in the Low Countries, and this
without losing any of the loyalty of the middle and upper classes,
Protestantism having made its converts only among the poor. In 1546 too
he had set up an <i lang="la">Index Expurgatorius</i> with the
assistance of the theological faculty at Louvain; and there was
actually a Flemish <i>Index</i> in print before the papal one (McCrie,
<i>Ref. in Italy</i>, p. 184; Ticknor, <i>Hist. of Spanish Lit.</i> 6th
ed. i, 493).</p>
<p>What set up the breach between the Netherlands and Spain was the
failure of Philip II to adjust himself to Dutch interests as his father
had adjusted himself to Spanish. The sunderance was on lines of
economic interest and racial jealousy; and Dutch Protestantism was not
the cause but the effect. In the war, indeed, multitudes of Dutch
Catholics held persistently with their Protestant fellow-countrymen
against Spain, as many English Catholics fought against the Armada. As
late as 1600 the majority of the people of Groningen were still
Catholics, as the great majority are now in North Brabant and Limburg;
and in 1900 the Catholics in the Netherlands were nearly a third of the
whole. From first to last too the Dutch Protestant creed and polity
were those set up by Calvin, a Frenchman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To those accustomed to the conventional view, the case may become
clearer on a survey of the course of anti-papalism in other countries
than those mentioned. The political determination of the process in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>the sixteenth century, indeed, cannot be
properly realized save in the light of kindred movements of earlier
date, when the &ldquo;Teutonic conscience&rdquo; made, not for reform,
but for fixation.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That the causal forces in the Reformation were neither
racial religious bias nor special gift on the part of any religious
teachers is made tolerably clear by the pre-Lutheran episode of the
Hussites in Bohemia a century before the German movement. In Bohemia as
elsewhere clerical avarice, worldliness, and misconduct had long kept
up anti-clerical feeling; and the adoption of Wiclif&rsquo;s teaching
by Huss<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23181src" href="#xd25e23181" name=
"xd25e23181src">40</a> at the end of the fourteenth century was the
result, and not the cause, of Bohemian anti-papalism.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e23187src" href="#xd25e23187" name="xd25e23187src">41</a> The
Waldensians, whose doctrines were closely akin to those of Huss, were
represented in Bohemia as early as the twelfth century; and so late as
1330 their community was a teaching centre, able to send money help to
the Waldensians of Italy. So apparent was the heredity that &AElig;neas
Sylvius, afterwards Pope Pius II, maintained that the Hussites were a
branch of the Waldenses.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23193src" href=
"#xd25e23193" name="xd25e23193src">42</a></p>
<p>Before Huss too a whole series of native reformers, beginning with
the Moravian Militz, Archdeacon of Prague, had set up a partly
anti-clerical propaganda. Militz, who gave up his emoluments (1363) to
become a wandering preacher, actually wrote a <i lang="la">Libellus de
Anti-christo</i>, affirming that the Church was already in
Anti-christ&rsquo;s power, or nearly so.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23204src" href="#xd25e23204" name="xd25e23204src">43</a> It was
written while he was imprisoned by the Inquisition at Rome at the
instance of the mendicant orders, whom he censured. As, however, the
later hostility he incurred, up to his death, was on the score of his
influence with the people, the treatise cannot well have been current
in his lifetime. A contemporary, Conrad of Waldhausen, holding similar
views, joined Militz in opposing the mendicant friars as Wiclif was
doing at the same period; and the King of Bohemia (the emperor Charles
IV) gave zealous countenance to both. A follower of Militz, Matthias of
Janow, a prebendary of Prague, holding the same views as to
Anti-christ, wrote a book on <i>The Abomination of Desolation of
Priests and Monks</i>, and yet another to similar effect.</p>
<p>There was thus a considerable movement in the direction of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>Church reform before either Huss or Wiclif was
heard in Bohemia; and a Bohemian king had shown a reforming zeal,
apparently not on financial motives, before any other European
potentate. And whereas racial jealousy of the dominant Italians was a
main factor in the movement of Luther, the much more strongly motived
jealousy of the Czechs against the Germans who exploited Bohemia was a
main element in the salient movement of the Hussites.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e23217src" href="#xd25e23217" name="xd25e23217src">44</a>
Called in to work the silver mines, and led further by the increasing
field for commerce and industry,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23225src"
href="#xd25e23225" name="xd25e23225src">45</a> the more civilized
Germans secured control of the Czech church and monasteries,
appropriating most of the best livings. As they greatly predominated
also at the University of Prague, Huss, whose inspiration was largely
racial patriotism, wrought with his colleague Jerome to have the
university made strictly national.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23228src"
href="#xd25e23228" name="xd25e23228src">46</a> When, accordingly, the
German heads of the university still (1403 and 1408) condemned the
doctrines of Wiclif as preached by Huss, the motives of the censors
were as much racial and economic as theological; that is to say, the
&ldquo;Teutonic conscience&rdquo; operated in its own interest to the
exaltation of papal rule against the Czech conscience.</p>
<p>The first crisis in the racial struggle ended in Huss&rsquo;s
obtaining a royal decree (1409) giving three votes in university
affairs (wherein, according to medieval custom, the voting was by
nations) to the Bohemians, and only one to the Germans, though the
latter were the majority. Thereupon a multitude of the German students
marched back to Germany, where there was founded for them the
university of Leipzig;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23239src" href=
"#xd25e23239" name="xd25e23239src">47</a> and the racial quarrel was
more envenomed than ever.</p>
<p>At the same time the ecclesiastical authorities, closely allied with
the German interest, took up the cause of the Church against heresy;
and Archbishop Sbinko of Prague, having procured a papal bull, caused a
number of Wiclifian and other manuscripts to be burned<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23247src" href="#xd25e23247" name=
"xd25e23247src">48</a> (1410), soon after excommunicating Huss. The now
nationalist university protested, and the king sequestrated the estates
of the archbishop on his refusal to indemnify the owners of the
manuscripts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>In 1411, further, Huss denounced the proposed
papal crusade against Naples, and in 1412 the sale of indulgences by
permission of Pope John XXIII, exactly as Luther denounced those of Leo
X a century later, calling the Pope Antichrist in the Lutheran manner,
while his partizans burned the papal bulls.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23255src" href="#xd25e23255" name="xd25e23255src">49</a> For the
rest, he preached against image-worship, auricular confession,
ceremonialism, and clerical endowments.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23261src" href="#xd25e23261" name="xd25e23261src">50</a> At the
Council of Constance (1415), accordingly, there was arrayed against him
a solid mass of German churchmen, including the ex-rector of Prague
University, now bishop of Misnia. Further, the Germans were
scholastically, as a rule, Nominalists, and Huss a Realist; and as
Gerson, the most powerful of the French prelates, was zealous for the
former school, he threw his influence on the German side,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23264src" href="#xd25e23264" name=
"xd25e23264src">51</a> as did the Bishop of London on the part of
England.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23268src" href="#xd25e23268" name=
"xd25e23268src">52</a> The forty-five Wiclifian heresies, therefore,
were re-condemned; Huss was sentenced to imprisonment, though he had
gone to the Council under a letter of safe-conduct from the
emperor;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23271src" href="#xd25e23271" name=
"xd25e23271src">53</a> and on his refusal to retract he was burned
alive (July 6, 1415). Jerome, taking flight, was caught, and, being
imprisoned, recanted; but later revoked the recantation and was burned
likewise (May 30, 1416).</p>
<p>The subsequent fortunes of the Hussite party were determined as
usual by the political and economic forces. The King of Bohemia had
joyfully accepted Huss&rsquo;s doctrine that the tithes were not the
property of the churchmen; and had locally protected him as his
&ldquo;fowl with the golden eggs,&rdquo; proceeding to plunder the
Church as did the German princes in the next age.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23279src" href="#xd25e23279" name="xd25e23279src">54</a> When,
later, the revolutionary Hussites began plundering churches and
monasteries, the Bohemian nobles in their turn profited,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23282src" href="#xd25e23282" name=
"xd25e23282src">55</a> and became good Hussites accordingly; while yet
another aristocracy was formed in Prague by the citizens who managed
the confiscations there.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23285src" href=
"#xd25e23285" name="xd25e23285src">56</a> As happened earlier in
Hungary and later in Germany, again, there followed a revolt of the
peasants against their extortionate masters;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23290src" href="#xd25e23290" name="xd25e23290src">57</a> and
there resulted a period of ferocious civil war and exacerbated
fanaticism. Ziska, the Hussite leader, had been a strong
anti-German;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23295src" href="#xd25e23295"
name="xd25e23295src">58</a> and when the emperor entered into the
struggle the racial hatred grew more intense than ever. On the Hussite
side the claim for &ldquo;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418"
href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>cup&rdquo; (that is, the
administration of the eucharist with wine as well as bread, in the
original manner, departed from by the Church in the eleventh century)
indicated the nature of the religious feeling involved. More memorable
was the communistic zeal of the advanced section of the Taborites (so
called from the town of Tabor, their headquarters), who anticipated the
German movement of the Anabaptists,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23301src" href="#xd25e23301" name="xd25e23301src">59</a> a small
minority of them seeking to set up community of women. For the rest,
all the other main features of later Protestantism came up at the same
time&mdash;the zealous establishment of schools for the young;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23304src" href="#xd25e23304" name=
"xd25e23304src">60</a> the insistence on the Bible as the sole standard
of knowledge and practice; inflexible courage in warfare and good
military organization, with determined denial of sacerdotal
claims.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23310src" href="#xd25e23310" name=
"xd25e23310src">61</a></p>
<p>The ideal collapsed as similar ideals did before and afterwards.
First the main body of the Hussites, led by Ziska, though at war with
the Catholics in general and the Germans in particular, warred
murderously also on the extremer communists, called the Adamites, and
destroyed them (1421). Then, as the country became more and more
exhausted by the civil war, the common people gradually fell away from
the Taborites, who were the prime fanatics of the period. The zeal of
the communist section, too, itself fell away; and at length, in 1434,
the Taborites, betrayed by one of their generals, were defeated with
great slaughter by the nobles in the battle of Lipan. Meanwhile, the
upper aristocracy had reaped the economic fruits of the revolution at
the expense of townsmen, small proprietors, and peasants;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23315src" href="#xd25e23315" name=
"xd25e23315src">62</a> and, just as the lot of the German peasants in
Luther&rsquo;s day was worse after their vain revolt than before, so
the Bohemian peasantry at the close of the fifteenth century had sunk
back to the condition of serfdom from which they had almost completely
emerged at the beginning. It is doubtful, indeed, whether the material
lot of the poor was bettered in any degree at any stage of the
Protestant revolution, in any country. So little efficacy for social
betterment has a movement guided by a light set above reason.</p>
<p>That there was in the period some Christian freethinking of a finer
sort than the general Taborite doctrine is proved by the recovery of
the unprinted work of the Czech Peter Helchitsky (Chelcicky), <i>The
Net of Faith</i>, which impeached the current orthodoxy and the
ecclesiastico-political system on the lines of the more <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>exalted of the Paulicians and the Lollards, very
much to the same effect as the modern gospel of Tolstoy. In the midst
of a party of warlike fanatics Helchitsky denounced war as mere
wholesale murder, taught the sinfulness of wealth, declaimed against
cities as the great corrupters of life, and preached a peaceful and
non-resistant anarchism, ignoring the State. But his party in turn
developed into that of the Bohemian Brethren, an intensely Puritan
sect, opposed to learning, and ashamed of the memory of the communism
in which their order began.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23327src" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As in Bohemia, so in Hungary, there was a ready
popular inclination to religious independence of Rome before the
Lutheran period. The limited sway of the Hungarian monarchy left the
nobles abnormally powerful, and their normal jealousy of the wealth of
the Church made them in the thirteenth century favourable to the
Waldenses and recalcitrant to the Inquisition.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23340src" href="#xd25e23340" name="xd25e23340src">64</a> In the
period of the Hussite wars a similar protection was long given to the
thousands of refugees led by Ziska from Bohemia into Hungary in
1424.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23345src" href="#xd25e23345" name=
"xd25e23345src">65</a> The famous king Matthias Corvinus, who put
severe checks on clerical revenue, had as his favourite court poet the
anti-papal bishop of Wardein, John, surnamed Pannonicus, who openly
derided the Papal Jubilee as a financial contrivance.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e23350src" href="#xd25e23350" name="xd25e23350src">66</a> Under
Matthias&rsquo;s successor, the ill-fated Uladislaus II, began a
persecution, pushed on by his priest-ruled queen (1440), which drove
many Hussites into Wallachia; and at the date of Luther&rsquo;s
movement the superior clergy of Hungary were a powerful body of feudal
nobles, living mainly as such, wielding secular power, and
impoverishing the State.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23355src" href=
"#xd25e23355" name="xd25e23355src">67</a> As the crusade got up by the
papacy against the Turks (1514) drew away many serfs, and ended in a
peasant war against the nobility, put down with immense slaughter, and
followed by oppression both of peasants and small landholders, there
was a ready hearing for the Lutheran doctrines in Hungary. Nowhere,
probably, did so many join the Reformation movement in so short a
time.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23360src" href="#xd25e23360" name=
"xd25e23360src">68</a> As elsewhere, a number of the clergy came
forward; and the resistance of the rest was proportionally severe,
though Queen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>Mary, the wife of King Louis II, was
pro-Lutheran.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23368src" href="#xd25e23368"
name="xd25e23368src">69</a> Books were burned by cartloads; and the
diet was induced to pass a general decree for the burning of all
Lutherans.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23373src" href="#xd25e23373"
name="xd25e23373src">70</a> The great Turkish invasion under Soliman
(1526) could not draw the priests from their heresy-hunt; but the
subsequent division of sovereignty between John Zapoyla and Ferdinand
I, and above all the disdainful tolerance of the Turkish Sultan in the
parts under his authority,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23378src" href=
"#xd25e23378" name="xd25e23378src">71</a> permitted of a continuous
spread of the anti-papal doctrine. About 1546 four bishops joined the
Lutheran side, one getting married; and in Transylvania in particular
the whole Church property was ere long confiscated to &ldquo;the
State&rdquo;; so that in 1556, when only two monasteries remained, the
Bishop withdrew. Of the tithes, it is said, the Protestant clergy held
three-fourths, and retained them till 1848.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23383src" href="#xd25e23383" name="xd25e23383src">72</a> In 1559,
according to the same authority, only three families of magnates still
adhered to the pope; the lesser nobility were nearly all Protestant;
and the Lutherans among the common people were as thirty to
one.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23388src" href="#xd25e23388" name=
"xd25e23388src">73</a></p>
<p>As a matter of course, Church property had been confiscated on all
hands by the nobles, Ferdinand having been unable to hinder them. Soon
after the battle of Moh&auml;cs (1526) the nobles in diet decided not
to fill up the places of deceased prelates, but to make over the
emoluments of the bishoprics to &ldquo;such men as deserved well of
their country.&rdquo; Within a short time seven great territories were
so accorded to as many magnates and generals, &ldquo;nearly all of whom
separated from the Church of Rome, and became steady supporters of the
Reformation.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23395src" href=
"#xd25e23395" name="xd25e23395src">74</a> The Hungarian
&ldquo;Reformation&rdquo; was thus remarkably complete.</p>
<p>Its subsequent decadence is one of the proofs that, even as the
Reformation movement had succeeded by secular force, so it was only to
be maintained on the same footing by excluding Catholic propaganda. In
Hungary, as elsewhere, strife speedily arose among Reformers on the two
issues on which reason could play within the limits of
Scripturalism&mdash;the doctrine of the eucharist and the divinity of
Jesus. On the former question the majority took the semi-rationalist
view of Zwingli, making the eucharist a simple commemoration; and a
strong minority in Transylvania became Socinian. The Italian Unitarian
Giorgio Biandrata (or Blandrata<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23402src"
href="#xd25e23402" name="xd25e23402src">75</a>), driven to Poland from
Switzerland for his anti-trinitarianism, and called from Poland to be
the physician of the Prince of Transylvania, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>organized a ten days&rsquo; debate between
Trinitarians and Unitarians at Weissenberg in 1568; and at the close
the latter obtained from the nobles present all the privileges enjoyed
by the Lutherans, even securing control of the cathedral and schools of
Clausenburg.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23407src" href="#xd25e23407"
name="xd25e23407src">76</a> It is remarkable that this, the most
advanced movement of Protestantism, has practically held its ground in
Transylvania to modern times.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23410src"
href="#xd25e23410" name="xd25e23410src">77</a></p>
<p>The advance, however, meant desperate schism, and disaster to the
main Protestant cause. The professors of Wittemberg appealed to the
orthodox authorities to suppress the heresy, with no better result than
a public repudiation of the doctrine of the Trinity at the Synod of
Wardein,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23415src" href="#xd25e23415" name=
"xd25e23415src">78</a> and an organization of the Unitarian Churches.
In due course these in turn divided. In 1578 Biandrata&rsquo;s
colleague, Ferencz Davides, contended for a cessation of prayers to
Christ, whereupon Biandrata invited Fausto Sozzini from Basel to
confute him; and the confutation finally took the shape of a sentence
of perpetual imprisonment on Davides in 1579 by the Prince of
Transylvania, to whom Biandrata and Sozzini referred the dispute. The
victim died in a few days&mdash;by one account, in a state of
frenzy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23420src" href="#xd25e23420" name=
"xd25e23420src">79</a> Between the Helvetic and Augsburg
confessionalists, meanwhile, the strife was equally bitter; and it
needed only free scope for the new organization of the Jesuits to
secure the reconquest of the greater part of Hungary for the Catholic
Church.</p>
<p>The course of events had shown that the Protestant principle of
private judgment led those who would loyally act on it further and
further from the historic faith; and there was no such general spirit
of freethought in existence as could support such an advance. In
contrast with the ever-dividing and mutually anathematizing parties of
the dissenters, the ostensible solidity of the Catholic Church had an
attraction which obscured all former perception of her corruptions; and
the fixity of her dogma reassured those who recoiled in horror from
Zwinglianism and Socinianism, as the adherents of these systems
recoiled in turn from that of Davides. Only the absolute suppression of
the Jesuits, as in Elizabethan England, could have saved the situation;
and the political circumstances which had facilitated the spread of
Protestantism were equally favourable to the advent of the reaction. As
the Huguenot nobles in France gradually withdrew from their sect in the
seventeenth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>century, so the Protestant nobles in Hungary
began to withdraw from theirs towards the end of the sixteenth. What
the Jesuits could not achieve by propaganda was compassed by imperial
dragonnades; and in 1601 only a few Protestant congregations remained
in all Styria and Carinthia.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23430src" href=
"#xd25e23430" name="xd25e23430src">80</a> Admittedly, however, the
Jesuits wrought much by sheer polemic, the pungent writings of their
Cardinal Pazm&aacute;ny having the effect of converting a number of
nobles;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23435src" href="#xd25e23435" name=
"xd25e23435src">81</a> while the Protestants, instead of answering the
most effective of Pazm&aacute;ny&rsquo;s attacks, <i>The Guide to
Truth</i>, spent their energies in fighting each other.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23443src" href="#xd25e23443" name=
"xd25e23443src">82</a></p>
<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries there ensued enough of
persecution by the Catholic rulers to have roused a new growth of
Protestantism, if that could longer avail; but the balance of forces
remained broadly unchanged. Orthodox Protestantism and orthodox
Unitarianism, having no new principle of criticism as against those
turned upon themselves by the Jesuits, and no new means of obtaining an
economic leverage, have made latterly no headway against Catholicism,
which is to-day professed by more than half the people of Hungary,
while among the remainder the Greek Catholics and Greek Orientals
respectively outnumber the Helvetic and Lutheran Churches. The future
is to some more searching principle of thought.</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 5. <i>Protestantism in Poland</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The chief triumph of the Jesuit reaction was won in
Poland; and there, perhaps, is to be found the best illustration of the
failure of mere Protestantism, on the one hand, to develop a
self-maintaining intellectual principle, and the worse failure, on the
other hand, of an organized and unresisted Catholicism to secure either
political or intellectual vitality.</p>
<p>Opposition to the papacy on nationalist as well as on general
grounds is nearly as well marked in Polish history as in Bohemian, from
the pagan period onwards, the first Christian priesthood being chiefly
foreign,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23459src" href="#xd25e23459" name=
"xd25e23459src">83</a> while, as in Bohemia, the people clung to
vernacular worship. In 1078 we find King Boleslav the Dauntless
(otherwise the Cruel) executing the Bishop of Cracow, taxing the lands
of the Church, and vetoing the bestowal of posts on
foreigners.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23465src" href="#xd25e23465"
name="xd25e23465src">84</a> He in turn was driven into exile by a
combination of clergy and nobles. A century later a Polish diet vetoes
the confiscation of the property <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423"
href="#pb423" name="pb423">423</a>]</span>of deceased bishops by the
sovereign princes of the various provinces; and a generation later
still the veto is seen to be disregarded.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23472src" href="#xd25e23472" name="xd25e23472src">85</a> In the
middle of the thirteenth century there are further violent quarrels
between dukes and clergy over tithes, the former successfully ordering
and the latter vainly resisting a money commutation; till in 1279 Duke
Boleslav of Cracow is induced to grant the bishops almost unlimited
immunities and powers.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23477src" href=
"#xd25e23477" name="xd25e23477src">86</a> Under Casimir the Great
(1333&ndash;1370) further strifes occur on similar grounds between the
equestrian order and the clergy, the king sometimes supporting the
latter against the former, as in the freeing of serfs, and sometimes
enforcing taxation of Church lands with violence.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23483src" href="#xd25e23483" name="xd25e23483src">87</a> In the
next reign the immunities granted by Boleslav in 1279 are cancelled by
the equestrian order, acting in concert. And while these strifes had
all been on economic grounds, we meet in 1341 with a heretical
movement, set up by John Pirnensis, who denounced the pope as
Antichrist in the fashion of the Bohemian reformers of the next
generation. The people of Breslau seem to have gone over bodily to the
heresy; and when the Inquisition of Cracow attempted forcible
repression the Chief Inquisitor was murdered in a riot.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23488src" href="#xd25e23488" name=
"xd25e23488src">88</a></p>
<p>It was thus natural that in the fourteenth century the Hussite
movement should spread greatly in Poland, and the papacy be defied in
matters of nomination by the king.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23495src"
href="#xd25e23495" name="xd25e23495src">89</a> The Poles had long
frequented the university of Prague; and Huss&rsquo;s colleague Jerome
was called in to organize the university of Cracow in 1413. Against the
Hussite doctrines the Catholic clergy had to resort largely to written
polemic,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23500src" href="#xd25e23500" name=
"xd25e23500src">90</a> their power being small; though the king
confirmed their synodical decree making heresy high treason. In 1450
Poland obtained its law of Habeas Corpus,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23505src" href="#xd25e23505" name="xd25e23505src">91</a> over two
centuries before England; and under that safeguard numbers of the
nobility declared themselves Hussites. In 1435 some of the chief of
these formed a confederation against Church and crown; and in 1439 they
proclaimed an abolition of tithes, and demanded, on the lines of the
earlier English Lollards, that the enormous estates of the clergy
should be appropriated to public purposes. In the diet of 1459, again,
a learned noble, John Ostrorog, who had studied at Padua, delivered an
address, afterwards expanded into a Latin book, denouncing the revenue
exactions of the papacy, and proposing to confiscate the annates, or
first fruits of ecclesiastical offices so exacted; proceeding further
to bring against the Polish clergy in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb424" href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>general all the usual
charges of simony, avarice, and fraud, and indicting the mendicant
orders as having demoralized the common people.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23512src" href="#xd25e23512" name="xd25e23512src">92</a></p>
<p>The Poles having no such nationalist motive in their Hussitism as
had the Bohemians, who were fighting German domination, there took
place in Poland no such convulsions as followed the Bohemian movement;
but, when the Lutheran impulse came in the next century, the German
element which had been added to Poland by the incorporation of the
order and territory of the Teutonic knights in 1466 made an easy way
for the German heresy. In Dantzic the Lutheran inhabitants in 1524 took
the churches from the Catholics, and, terrorizing the town council,
shut up and secularized the monasteries and convents.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e23519src" href="#xd25e23519" name="xd25e23519src">93</a> In
1526, with due bloodshed, the king effected a counter-revolution in the
Catholic interest; but still the heresy spread, the law of Habeas
Corpus thwarting all clerical attempts at persecution, and the king
being at heart something of an indifferentist in religion.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23524src" href="#xd25e23524" name=
"xd25e23524src">94</a> In the province of Great Poland was formed
(1530&ndash;40) a Lutheran church, protected by a powerful family; and
in Cracow a group of scholars formed a non-sectarian organization to
evangelize the country. Among them, about 1546, occurred the first
expression of Polish Unitarianism, the innovator being Adam Pastoris, a
Dutch or Belgian priest, who seems to have used at times the name of
Spiritus.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23529src" href="#xd25e23529" name=
"xd25e23529src">95</a></p>
<p>On lines of simple Protestantism the movement was rapid, many
aristocrats and clergy declaring for it;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23539src" href="#xd25e23539" name="xd25e23539src">96</a> and in
the Diets of 1550 and 1552 was shown an increasingly strong
anti-Catholic feeling, which the Church was virtually powerless to
punish. In 1549 a parish priest publicly married a wife, and the bishop
of Cracow abandoned the attempt to displace him. The next bishop,
Zebrzydowski, a favourite pupil of Erasmus, was said by a Socinian
writer of the period to have openly expressed disbelief in immortality
and other dogmas;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23545src" href=
"#xd25e23545" name="xd25e23545src">97</a> but when in 1552 a noble
refused to pay tithes, he ecclesiastically condemned him to death, and
declared his property confiscated. The sentence, however, could not be
put in force; and when the other heads of the Church, seeing their
revenues menaced and their clergy in large part tending to
heresy,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23550src" href="#xd25e23550" name=
"xd25e23550src">98</a> attempted a general and severe prosecution of
backsliding priests, the resistance of the magistracy brought the
effort to nothing.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23558src" href=
"#xd25e23558" name="xd25e23558src">99</a> The Diet of 1552 <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>practically abrogated the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction; and despite much intrigue the economic interest of the
landowners continued to maintain the Protestant movement, which was
rapidly organized on German and Swiss models. It was by the play of its
own elements of strife that its ascendancy was undermined.</p>
<p>On the one hand, an influential cleric, Orzechowski, who had married
and turned Protestant, reconciled himself to Rome on the death of his
wife, having already begun a fierce polemic against the Unitarian
tendencies appearing on the Protestant side in the teaching of the
Italian Stancari (1550); on the other hand, those tendencies gained
head till they ruptured the party, of which the Trinitarian majority
further quarrelled violently among themselves till, as in Hungary, many
were driven back to the arms of Catholicism. In a Synod held in 1556,
one Peter Goniondzki<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23567src" href=
"#xd25e23567" name="xd25e23567src">100</a> (Gonesius)&mdash;who as a
Catholic had violently opposed Stancari in 1550, but in the interim had
studied in Switzerland and turned Protestant&mdash;took up a more
anti-Trinitarian position than Stancari&rsquo;s, affirming three Gods,
of whom the Son and the Spirit were subordinate to the Father. A few
years later he declared against infant baptism&mdash;here giving forth
opinions he had met with in Moravia; and he rapidly drew to him a
considerable following alike of ministers and of wealthy
laymen.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23572src" href="#xd25e23572" name=
"xd25e23572src">101</a></p>
<p>It was thus not the primary influence of Lelio Sozzini, who had
visited Poland in 1551 and did not return till 1558, that set up the
remarkable growth of Unitarianism in that country. It would seem rather
that in the country of Copernicus the relative weakness of the Church
had admitted of a more common approach to freedom of thought than was
seen elsewhere;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23577src" href="#xd25e23577"
name="xd25e23577src">102</a> and the impunity of the new movements
brought many heterodox fugitives (as it did Jews) from other lands. One
of the newcomers, the learned Italian, George Biandrata, whose
Unitarianism had been cautiously veiled, was made one of the
superintendents of the &ldquo;Helvetic&rdquo; Church of Little Poland,
and aimed at avoidance of dogmatic strifes; but after his withdrawal to
Transylvania Gregorius Pauli, a minister of Cracow, of Italian descent,
went further than Gonesius had done, and declared Jesus to be a mere
man.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23582src" href="#xd25e23582" name=
"xd25e23582src">103</a> He further preached community of goods,
promised a speedy millennium, and condemned the bearing of
arms.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23585src" href="#xd25e23585" name=
"xd25e23585src">104</a> After various attempts at suppression and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>compromise by the orthodox majority, a group of
Unitarian ministers and nobles formally renounced the doctrine of the
Trinity at the Conference of Petrikov in 1562; and, on a formal
condemnation being passed by an orthodox majority at Cracow in 1563,
there was formed a Unitarian Church, with forty-two subscribing
ministers, Zwinglian as to the eucharist, and opposed to infant
baptism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23593src" href="#xd25e23593" name=
"xd25e23593src">105</a> Ethically, its doctrine was humane and
pacificatory, its members being forbidden to go to law or to take
oaths; and for a time the community made great progress, the national
Diet being, by one account, &ldquo;filled with Arians&rdquo; for a
time.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23597src" href="#xd25e23597" name=
"xd25e23597src">106</a></p>
<p>Meantime the Calvinist, Zwinglian, and Lutheran Protestant Churches
quarrelled as fiercely in Poland as elsewhere, every compromise
breaking down, till the abundant relapses of nobles and common people
to Catholicism began to rebuild the power of the old Church, which
found in &ldquo;the Great Cardinal,&rdquo; Hosius, a statesman and
controversialist unequalled on the Protestant side. Backed by the
Jesuits, he gained by every Protestant dispute, the Jesuit order
building itself up with its usual skill. And the course of politics
told conclusively in the same direction. King Stephen Battory favoured
the Jesuits; and King Sigismund III, who had been educated as a
Catholic by his mother, systematically gave effect to his personal
leanings by the use of his peculiar feudal powers. Under the ancient
constitution the king had the bestowal of a number of life-tenures of
great estates, called <i>starosties</i>; and the granting of these
Sigismund made conditional on the acceptance of Catholicism.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23607src" href="#xd25e23607" name=
"xd25e23607src">107</a> Thus the Protestantism of the nobles, which had
been in large part originally determined by economic interests, was
dissolved by a reversal of the same force, very much in the fashion in
which it was disintegrated in France by the policy of Richelieu at the
same period. At the close of Sigismund&rsquo;s reign Protestantism was
definitively broken up; and the Jesuit ascendancy permitted even of
frequent persecutions of heresy. From these Unitarians could not
escape; and at length, in 1658, they were expelled from the country,
now completely subject to Jesuitism. In the country in which
Protestantism and Unitarianism in turn had spread most rapidly under
favouring political and social conditions, the rise of contrary
conditions had most rapidly and decisively overthrown them.</p>
<p>The record of the heresy of Poland, Bohemia, and Hungary, in fine,
is very much a reduplication of that of early Christianity.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>Men presented with an obscure and
self-contradictory &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; set themselves zealously to
extract from it a body of certain truth, and in that hopeless
undertaking did but multiply strife, till the majority, wearied with
the fruitless quest, resigned themselves like their ancient prototypes
to a rule of dogma under which the reasoning faculty became inert. Sane
rationalism had to find another path, in a more enlightened day.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The political and economic conditioning of the
Reformation may perhaps best be understood by following the fortunes of
Protestantism in France. When Luther began his schism, France might
reasonably have been held a much more likely field for its extension
than England. While King Henry was still to earn from the papacy the
title of &ldquo;Defender of the Faith&rdquo; as against Luther, King
Francis had exacted from the Pope (1516) a Concordat by which the
appointment of all abbots and bishops in France was vested in the
crown, the papacy receiving only the annates, or first year&rsquo;s
revenue. For centuries too the French throne and the papacy had been
chronically at strife; for seventy years a French pope, subservient to
the king, had sat at Avignon; and before the Concordat the
&ldquo;Pragmatic Sanction,&rdquo; first enacted in 1268 by the devout
St. Louis, had since the reign of Charles VII, who reinforced it
(1438), kept the Gallican Church on a semi-independent footing towards
Rome. By the account of the chancellor Du Prat in 1517, the
&ldquo;Pragmatic,&rdquo; then superseded by the Concordat, had isolated
France among the Catholic peoples, causing her to be regarded as
inclined to heresy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23627src" href=
"#xd25e23627" name="xd25e23627src">108</a> In 1512 the Council of Pisa,
convoked by Louis XII, had denounced Pope Julius II as a dangerous
schismatic, and he had retaliated by placing France under interdict. In
the previous year the French king had given his protection to a famous
farce by Pierre Gringoire, in which, on Shrove Tuesday, the Pope was
openly ridiculed.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23633src" href=
"#xd25e23633" name="xd25e23633src">109</a> Nowhere, in short, was the
papacy as such less respected.</p>
<p>The whole strife, however, between the French kings and the popes
had been for revenue, not on any question of doctrine. In the three
years (1461&ndash;64) during which Louis XI had for his own purposes
suspended the Pragmatic Sanction, it was found that 2,500,000 crowns
had gone from France to Rome for &ldquo;expetatives&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dispensations,&rdquo; besides 340,000 crowns for bulls for
archbishoprics, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428"
name="pb428">428</a>]</span>bishoprics, abbeys, priories, and
deaneries.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23643src" href="#xd25e23643"
name="xd25e23643src">110</a> This drain was naturally resisted by
Church and Crown alike. Louis XI restored the Pragmatic Sanction. Louis
XII re-enacted it in 1499 with new severity; and the effect of the
Concordat of Francis I was merely to win over the Pope by dividing
between the king and him the power of plunder by the sale of
ecclesiastical offices.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23649src" href=
"#xd25e23649" name="xd25e23649src">111</a> It was accordingly much
resented by the Parlement, the University, the clergy, and the people
of Paris; but the king overbore all opposition. Though, therefore, he
had at times some disposition to make a &ldquo;reform&rdquo; on the
Lutheran lines, he had no such motive thereto as had the kings and
nobles of the other northern countries; and he had further no such
personal motive as had Henry VIII of England. Under the existing
arrangement he was as well provided for as might be, since &ldquo;the
patronage of some six hundred bishoprics and abbeys furnished him with
a convenient and inexpensive method of providing for his diplomatic
service, and of rewarding literary merit.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23654src" href="#xd25e23654" name="xd25e23654src">112</a> The
troubles in Germany, besides, were a warning against letting loose a
movement of popular fanaticism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23657src"
href="#xd25e23657" name="xd25e23657src">113</a></p>
<p>When, therefore, Protestantism and Lutheranism <span class="corr"
id="xd25e23662" title="Source: begun">began</span> to show head in
France, they had no friends at once powerful and zealous. Before
Luther, in 1512, Jacques Lef&egrave;vre d&rsquo;&Eacute;taples laid
down in the commentary on his Latin translation of the Pauline Epistles
the Lutheran doctrine of grace, and in effect denied the received
doctrine of transubstantiation.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23665src"
href="#xd25e23665" name="xd25e23665src">114</a> In 1520 his former
pupil, Guillaume Bri&ccedil;onnet, Bishop of Meaux, invited him and
some younger reformers, among them Guillaume Farel, to join him in
teaching in his diocese; and in 1523 appeared Lef&egrave;vre&rsquo;s
translation of and commentary on the gospels, which effectually began
the Protestant movement in France.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23668src"
href="#xd25e23668" name="xd25e23668src">115</a></p>
<p>Persecution soon began. The king&rsquo;s adoring sister, Margaret,
Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on (afterwards Queen of Navarre), was the friend
of Bri&ccedil;onnet, but was powerless to help at home even her own
intimates.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23673src" href="#xd25e23673"
name="xd25e23673src">116</a> At first the king and his mother
encouraged the movement at Meaux while sending out a dozen preachers
through France to combat the Lutheran teaching;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23682src" href="#xd25e23682" name="xd25e23682src">117</a> but in
1524, setting out on his Italian campaign, the king saw fit to
conciliate his clergy, and his clerical chancellor Du Prat began
measures of repression, the queen-mother assenting, and
Bri&ccedil;onnet&rsquo;s own brother assisting. Already, in 1521, the
Sorbonne had condemned Luther&rsquo;s writings, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>Parlement of Paris had ordered the surrender of
all copies. In 1523 the works of Louis de Berquin, the anti-clerical
friend of Erasmus, were condemned, and himself imprisoned; and
Bri&ccedil;onnet consented to issue synodal decrees against
Luther&rsquo;s books and against certain Lutheran doctrines preached in
his own diocese. Only by the king&rsquo;s intervention was Berquin at
this time released.</p>
<p>The first man slain was Jean Chastellain, a shoemaker of Tournay,
burned at Vic in Lorraine on January 12, 1525. The next was a
wool-carder of Meaux,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23689src" href=
"#xd25e23689" name="xd25e23689src">118</a> who was first whipped and
branded for a fanatical outrage, then burned to death, with slow
tortures, for a further outrage against an image of the Virgin at Metz
(July, 1525). Later, an ecclesiastic of the Meaux group, Jacques Banvan
of Picardy, was prosecuted at Paris for anti-Lutheran heresy, and
publicly recanted; but repented, retracted his abjuration, and was
burned on the Place de Gr&egrave;ve, in August, 1526; a nameless
&ldquo;hermit of Livry&rdquo; suffering the same death about the same
time beside the cathedral of Notre Dame.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23695src" href="#xd25e23695" name="xd25e23695src">119</a>
Meantime Lef&egrave;vre had taken refuge in Strasburg, and, despite a
letter of veto from the king, now in captivity at Madrid, his works
were condemned by the Sorbonne. When released, the king not only
recalled him but made him tutor to his children. Ecclesiastical
pressures, however, forced him finally to take refuge under the Queen
of Navarre at N&eacute;rac, in Gascony, where he mourned his avoidance
of martyrdom.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23701src" href="#xd25e23701"
name="xd25e23701src">120</a></p>
<p>So determined had been the persecution that in 1526 Berquin was a
second time imprisoned, and with difficulty saved from death by the
written command of the captive king, sent on his sister&rsquo;s
appeal.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23709src" href="#xd25e23709" name=
"xd25e23709src">121</a> And when the released king, to secure the
deliverance of his hostage sons, felt bound to conciliate the Pope, and
to secure funds had to conciliate the clergy, Marguerite, compelled to
marry the king of Navarre, could do nothing more for
Protestantism,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23714src" href="#xd25e23714"

name="xd25e23720src">124</a> associated himself with the popular
indignation; and when the audacious Berquin, despite the dissuasions of
Erasmus, resumed his anti-Catholic polemic, and in particular undertook
to prove that B&eacute;da, the chief of the Sorbonne, was not a
Christian,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23723src" href="#xd25e23723"
name="xd25e23723src">125</a> he was re-arrested, tried, and condemned
to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430</a>]</span>publicly branded and imprisoned for life. On his
announcing an appeal to the absent king, and to the pope, a fresh
sentence, this time of death, was hurriedly passed; and he was
strangled and burned (1529) within two hours of the sentence,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23729src" href="#xd25e23729" name=
"xd25e23729src">126</a> to the intense joy of the ecclesiastical
multitude.</p>
<p>After various vacillations, the king in 1534 had the fresh pretext
of Protestant outrage&mdash;the affixing of an anti-Catholic placard in
all of the principal thoroughfares of Paris, and to the door of the
king&rsquo;s own room<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23734src" href=
"#xd25e23734" name="xd25e23734src">127</a>&mdash;for permitting a fresh
persecution after he had refused the Pope&rsquo;s request that he
should join in a general extermination of heresy,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23737src" href="#xd25e23737" name="xd25e23737src">128</a> and
there began at Paris a series of human sacrifices. It will have been
observed that Protestant outrages had provoked previous executions; and
there is some ground for the view that, but for the new and
exasperating outrage of 1534, the efforts which were being officially
made for a <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i> might have met with
success.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23743src" href="#xd25e23743" name=
"xd25e23743src">129</a> This hope was now frustrated. In November,
1534, seven men were condemned to be burned alive, one of them for
printing Lutheran books. In December others followed; and in January,
1535, on the occasion of a royal procession &ldquo;to appease the wrath
of God,&rdquo; six Lutherans (by one account, three by another) were
burned alive by slow fires, one of the victims being a
school-mistress.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23746src" href=
"#xd25e23746" name="xd25e23746src">130</a> It was on this occasion that
the king, in a public speech, declared: &ldquo;Were one of my arms
infected with this poison, I would cut it off. Were my own children
tainted, I should immolate them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23750src" href="#xd25e23750" name="xd25e23750src">131</a></p>
<p>Under such circumstances religious zeal naturally went far. In six
months there were passed 102 sentences of death, of which twenty-seven
were executed, the majority of the condemned having escaped by flight.
Thereafter the individual burnings are past counting. On an old demand
of the Sorbonne, the king actually sent to the Parlement an edict
abolishing the art of printing;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23758src"
href="#xd25e23758" name="xd25e23758src">132</a> which he duly recalled
when the Parlement declined to register it. But the French Government
was now committed to persecution. The Sorbonne&rsquo;s declaration
against Luther in 1521 had proclaimed as to the heretics that
&ldquo;their impious and shameless arrogance must be restrained by
chains, by censures&mdash;nay, by fire and flame, rather than confuted
by argument&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23761src" href=
"#xd25e23761" name="xd25e23761src">133</a> and in that spirit the
ruling clergy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>proceeded, the king abetting them. In 1543 he
ordained that heresy should be punished as sedition;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e23769src" href="#xd25e23769" name="xd25e23769src">134</a> and
in 1545 occurred the massacres of the Vaudois, before described. The
result of this and further savageries was simply the wider diffusion of
heresy, and a whole era of civil war, devastation, and
demoralization.</p>
<p>Meantime Calvin had been driven abroad, to found a Protestant polity
at Geneva and give a lead to those of England and Scotland. The balance
of political forces prevented a Protestant polity in France; but
nowhere else in the sixteenth century did Protestantism fight so long
and hard a battle. That the Reformation was a product of
&ldquo;Teutonic conscience&rdquo; is an inveterate fallacy.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23774src" href="#xd25e23774" name=
"xd25e23774src">135</a> The country in which Protestantism was
intellectually most disinterested and morally most active was France.
&ldquo;The main battle of erudition and doctrine against the Catholic
Church,&rdquo; justly contends Guizot, &ldquo;was sustained by the
French reformers; it was in France and Holland, and always in French,
that most of the philosophic, historical, and polemic works on that
side were written; neither Germany nor England, certainly, employed in
the cause at that epoch more intelligence and science.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23780src" href="#xd25e23780" name=
"xd25e23780src">136</a> Nor was there in France&mdash;apart from the
provocative insults to Catholics above mentioned&mdash;any such licence
on the Protestant side as arose in Germany, though the French
Protestants were as violently intolerant as any. Their ultimate
decline, after long and desperate wars ending in a political
compromise, was due to the play of socio-economic causes under the wise
and tolerant administration of Richelieu, who opened the royal services
to the Protestant nobles.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23785src" href=
"#xd25e23785" name="xd25e23785src">137</a> The French character had
proved as unsubduable in Protestantism as any other; and the generation
which in large part gradually reverted to Catholicism did but show that
it had learned the lesson of the strifes which had followed on the
Reformation&mdash;that Protestantism was no solution of either the
moral or the intellectual problems of religion and politics.</p>

<p class="first">It was thus by no predilection or faculty of

alliance knit between Church and Crown in the times when the latter

orthodox than any of the other leading States of Northern
Europe.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23808src" href="#xd25e23808" name=
"xd25e23808src">140</a> Henry was himself passionately orthodox, and
was much less of a reformer in his mental attitude than was Wolsey, who
had far-reaching schemes for de-Romanizing the Church alike in England
and France, and who actually gave the king a handle against him by his
plans for turning Church endowments to educational purposes.<a class=

"xd25e23828src">141</a> The personal need of the despotic king for a
divorce which the pope dared not give him was the first adequate lead
to the rejection of the papal authority. On this the plunder of the

"xd25e23835src">142</a> of precaution against papal influence, and for
the creation of a body of new interests vitally hostile to a papal
restoration. The king and the mass of the people were alike Catholics
in doctrine; the Protestant nobles who ruled under Edward VI were for
the most part mere cynical plunderers, appropriating alike Church
goods, lands, and school endowments more shamelessly than even did the
potentates of Germany; and on the accession of Queen Mary the nation
gladly reverted to Romish usages, though the spoil-holders would not
surrender a yard of Church lands.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23841src"
href="#xd25e23841" name="xd25e23841src">143</a> Had there been a
succession of Catholic sovereigns, Catholicism would certainly have
been restored. Protestantism was only slowly built up by the new
clerical and heretical propaganda, and by the state of hostility set up
between England and the Catholic Powers. It was the episode of the
Spanish Armada that, by identifying Catholicism with the cause of the
great national enemy, made the people grow definitely anti-Catholic.
Even in Shakespeare&rsquo;s dramas the old state of things is seen not
yet vitally changed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433"

<p>In Scotland, though there the priesthood had fewer friends than
almost anywhere else, the act of Reformation was mainly one of pure and
simple plunder of Church property by the needy nobility, in conscious
imitation of the policy of Henry VIII, at a time when the throne was
vacant; and there too Protestant doctrine was only gradually
established by the new race of preachers, trained in the school of
Calvin. In Ireland, on the other hand, Protestantism became identified
with the cause of the oppressor, just as for England Romanism was the
cause of the enemy-in-chief. &ldquo;Race&rdquo; and &ldquo;national
character,&rdquo; whatever they may be understood to mean, had nothing
whatever to do with the course of events, and doctrinal enlightenment
had just as little.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23853src" href=
"#xd25e23853" name="xd25e23853src">144</a> In the words of a
distinguished clerical historian: &ldquo;No truth is more certain than
this, that the real motives of religious action do not work on men in
masses; and that the enthusiasm which creates Crusaders, Inquisitors,
Hussites, Puritans, is not the result of conviction, but of passion
provoked by oppression or resistance, maintained by self-will, or
stimulated by the mere desire of victory.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23862src" href="#xd25e23862" name="xd25e23862src">145</a> To this
it need only be added that the desire of gain is also a factor, and
that accordingly the anti-papal movement succeeded where the balance of
political forces could be turned against the clerical interest, and
failed where the latter predominated. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<i>Id.</i> pp. 89, 98, 215. McCrie thinks it useful to suggest (p. 95)
that anti-trinitarianism seems to have begun at Siena, &ldquo;whose
inhabitants were proverbial among their countrymen for levity and
inconstancy of mind&rdquo;&mdash;citing Dante, <i>Inferno</i>, canto
xxix, 121&ndash;23. Thus does theology illumine sociology. In a note on
the same page the historian cites the testimony of Melanchthon
(<i>Epist.</i> coll. 852, 941) as to the commonness of &ldquo;Platonic
and skeptical theories&rdquo; among his Italian correspondents in
general; and quotes further the words of Calvin, who for once rises
above invective to explain as to heresy (<i>Opera</i>, viii, 510) that
&ldquo;<span lang="la">In Italis, <i>propter rarum acumen</i>, magis
eminet.</span>&rdquo; The historian omits, further, to trace German
Unitarianism to the levity of a particular community in
Germany.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd25e22934src">&uarr;</a></p>

were so few that they could easily be counted. Von Reumont, as cited,

that perjurers could be found in Naples to swear to anything, and that

Signor Orano gives the name as Buzio, citing the 1835 Italian
translation of McCrie, and pronouncing Cant&ugrave; (ii, 338) wrong in
making it Mollio. But in the 1856 ed. of McCrie&rsquo;s work the name
is given (pp. 57&ndash;58, 168&ndash;69) as John Mollio. Cant&ugrave;
then appears to have been right; but the date he gives, 1533, seems to

<p class="first">In the circumstances set forth in the last chapter,
the Reformation could stand for only the minimum of freethought needed
to secure political action. Some decided unbelief there was within its
original sphere;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23890src" href=
"#xd25e23890" name="xd25e23890src">1</a> the best known instance being
the private latitudinarianism of such humanist teachers as Mutianus
(Mudt) and Crotus (J&auml;ger), of the Erfurt University, in the
closing years of the fifteenth century. Trained in Italy, Mutianus,
after his withdrawal to private life at Gotha, in his private
correspondence<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23899src" href="#xd25e23899"
name="xd25e23899src">2</a> avowed the opinion that the sacred books
contained many designed fables; that the books of Job and Jonah were
such; and that there was a secret wisdom in the Moslem opinion that
Christ himself was not crucified, his place being taken by someone
resembling him. To his young friend Spalatin he propounded the
question: &ldquo;If Christ alone be the way, the truth, and the life,
how went it with the men who lived so many centuries before his birth?
Had they had no part in truth and salvation?&rdquo; And he hints the
answer that &ldquo;the religion of Christ did not begin with his
incarnation, but is as old as the world, as his birth from the Father.
For what is the real Christ, the only Son of God, save, as Paul says,
the Wisdom of God, with which he endowed not only the Jews in their
narrow Syrian land, but also the Greeks, the Romans, and the Germans,
however different might be their religious usages.&rdquo; Though some
such doctrine could be found in Eusebius,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23916src" href="#xd25e23916" name="xd25e23916src">3</a> it was
remarkable enough in the Germany of four hundred years ago. But
Mutianus went still further. To his friend Heinrich Urban he wrote that
&ldquo;there is but one God and one Goddess&rdquo; under the many forms
and names of Jupiter, Sol, Apollo, Moses, Christ, Luna, Ceres,
Proserpina, Tellus, Maria. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>prudently added, &ldquo;heed that you do not
spread it abroad. One must hide it in silence, like Eleusinian
mysteries. In religious matters we must avail ourselves of the cloak of
fable and enigma. Thou, with the grace of Jupiter&mdash;that is, the
best and greatest God&mdash;shouldst silently despise the little Gods.
When I say Jupiter, I mean Christ and the true God. But enough of these
all too high things.&rdquo; Such language hints of much current
rationalism that can now only be guessed at, since it was unsafe even
to write to friends as Mutianus did. On concrete matters of religion he
is even more pronounced, laughing at the worship of the coat and beard
and foreskin of Jesus, calling Lenten food fool&rsquo;s food,
contemning the begging monks, rejecting confession and masses for the
dead, and pronouncing the hours spent in altar-service lost time. In
his house at Gotha, behind the Cathedral, his friend Crotus burlesqued
the Mass, called the relics of saints bones from the gallows, and
otherwise blasphemed with his host.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23925src" href="#xd25e23925" name="xd25e23925src">4</a></p>
<p>But such esoteric doctrine and indoors unbelief can have had no part
in the main movement; and though at the same period we see among the
common people the satirist Heinrich Bebel, a Swabian peasant&rsquo;s
son, jesting for them over the doctrines of trinity in unity, the
resurrection, doomsday, and the sacraments,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e23941src" href="#xd25e23941" name="xd25e23941src">5</a> it is
certain that that influence counted for little in the way of serious
thinking. It was only as separate and serious heresies that such
doctrines could long propagate themselves; and Luther in his letter to
the people of Antwerp<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23944src" href=
"#xd25e23944" name="xd25e23944src">6</a> speaks of one sect or group as
rejecting baptism, another the eucharist, another the divinity of
Jesus, and yet another affirming a middle state between the present
life and the day of judgment. One teacher in Antwerp he describes as
saying that every man has the Holy Ghost, that being simply reason and
understanding, that there is no hell, and that doing as we would be
done by is faith; but this heretic does not seem to have founded a
sect. The most extensive wave of really innovating thought was that set
up by the social and anti-sacerdotal revolt of the Anabaptists, among
whom occurred also the first popular avowals of Unitarianism.</p>
<p>In the way of literature, Unitarian doctrine came from John
Campanus, of J&uuml;lich; Ludwig Hetzer, a priest of Z&uuml;rich; and
(in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span>a minor degree) Johann Denk, school-rector in
N&uuml;remberg in 1524,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23953src" href=
"#xd25e23953" name="xd25e23953src">7</a> and afterwards one of the
earlier leaders of the Anabaptist movement. All three were men of
academic training; and Hetzer, who wrote explicitly against the
divinity of Christ, had previously made with the aid of Denk a German
translation, which was used by Luther, of the Hebrew prophets (1527).
He was beheaded at Constance in 1529, nominally on the charge of
practising free-love.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e23973src" href=
"#xd25e23973" name="xd25e23973src">8</a> Campanus, who published a book
attacking the doctrine of the Trinity and the teaching of Luther, had
to leave Wittemberg in consequence, and finally died after a long
imprisonment in Cleve. Denk&mdash;an amiable and estimable man<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23976src" href="#xd25e23976" name=
"xd25e23976src">9</a>&mdash;is said, on very scant grounds, to have
recanted before he died.</p>
<p>Not only from such thoroughgoing heresy, but from the whole
Anabaptist secession, and no less from the rising of the peasants, the
main Lutheran movement kept itself utterly aloof; and, though the
Catholics naturally identified the extremer parties with the
Reformation, its official or &ldquo;Centre&rdquo; polity made little
for intellectual or political as distinct from ecclesiastical
innovation. Towards the Peasants&rsquo; Revolt, which at first he
favoured, inasmuch as the peasants, whom he had courted, came to him
for counsel, Luther&rsquo;s final attitude was so brutal that it has
to-day almost no apologist; and in this as in some of his other evil
departures the &ldquo;mild&rdquo; Melanchthon went with him.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e23986src" href="#xd25e23986" name=
"xd25e23986src">10</a> Their doctrine was the very negation of all
democracy, and must be interpreted as an absolute capitulation to the
nobles, without whose backing they knew themselves to be
ecclesiastically helpless. In the massacres to which Luther gave his
eager approval a hundred thousand men were destroyed.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e24001src" href="#xd25e24001" name="xd25e24001src">11</a>
&ldquo;From this time onwards,&rdquo; pronounces Baur, &ldquo;Luther
ceases to be the representative of the spirit of his time; he
represents only one side of it&#8202;&hellip;. Thenceforth his writings
have no more the universal bearing they once had, but only a
particular&#8202;&hellip;. In the political connection we must date
from Luther&rsquo;s attitude to the Peasants&rsquo; War the Lutheran
theory of unconditional obedience. Christianity, as Luther preached it,
has given to princes unlimited power of despotism and tyranny; while
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>the poor man, who, without right of protest,
must submit to everything, will be compensated for his earthly
sufferings in heaven.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24009src" href=
"#xd25e24009" name="xd25e24009src">12</a> Naturally the princes
henceforth grew more and more Lutheran.</p>
<p>As naturally the crushed peasantry turned away from the Reformation
in despair. Luther had in the first instance approached them, not they
him. Before the revolt the reformers had made the peasant a kind of
hero in their propaganda;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24017src" href=
"#xd25e24017" name="xd25e24017src">13</a> and when in the first and
moderate stage of the rising its motives were set forth in sixty-two
articles, these were purely agrarian. &ldquo;There is no trace of a
religious element in them, no indication that their authors had ever
heard of Luther or of the Gospel.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24020src" href="#xd25e24020" name="xd25e24020src">14</a> Then it
was that Luther commended them; and thereafter &ldquo;a religious
element began to obtrude.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24025src"
href="#xd25e24025" name="xd25e24025src">15</a> When the overthrow
began, doubtless sincerely reprobating the violences of the insurgents,
he hounded on the princes in their work of massacre, Melanchthon
chiming in. Thereafter, as Melanchthon admitted, the people showed a
detestation of the Lutheran clergy;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24030src" href="#xd25e24030" name="xd25e24030src">16</a> and
among many there was even developed a kind of &ldquo;materialistic
atheism.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24035src" href="#xd25e24035"
name="xd25e24035src">17</a></p>
<p>The political outcome, as aforesaid, was a thoroughly undemocratic
organization of Protestantism in Germany; and, though the
ecclesiastical tyranny which resulted from the more democratic system
of Calvin was not more favourable to progress or happiness, the final
German system of <i lang="la">cujus regio, ejus religio</i>&mdash;every
district taking the religion of its ruler&mdash;must be summed up as a
mere negation of the right of private judgment. Save for the attempt of
a Frenchman, Fran&ccedil;ois Lambert of Avignon, to organize a
self-governing church, German Protestantism showed almost no democratic
feeling.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24045src" href="#xd25e24045" name=
"xd25e24045src">18</a> The one poor excuse for Luther was that the
peasants had never recognized the need or duty of maintaining their
clergy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24048src" href="#xd25e24048" name=
"xd25e24048src">19</a> And seeing how the wealth of the Church went to
the nobles and the well-to-do, and how downtrodden were the peasants
all along, it would be surprising indeed if they had. They were not the
workers of the ecclesiastical Reformation, and it wrought little or
nothing for them.</p>
<p>The side on which the whole movement made for new light was its
promotion of common schools, which enabled many of the people for the
first time to read.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24055src" href=
"#xd25e24055" name="xd25e24055src">20</a> This tendency had been seen
among the Waldenses, the Lollards, and the Hussites, and for the same
reasons. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438</a>]</span>Such movements depended for their existence on
the reading of the sacred books by the people for themselves; and to
make readers was their first concern. In this connection, of course,
note must be taken of the higher educational revival <i>before</i> the
Reformation,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24071src" href="#xd25e24071"
name="xd25e24071src">21</a> without which the ecclesiastical revolution
could not have taken place even in Germany. As we saw, a literary
expansion preceded the Hussite movement in Bohemia; and the stir of
concern for written knowledge, delightedly acclaimed by Ulrich von
Hutten, is recognized by all thoughtful historians in Germany before
the rise of Luther. Such enlightenment as that of Mutianus was far in
advance of Luther&rsquo;s own; and enlightenment of a lower degree
cannot have been lacking. The ability to read, indeed, must have been
fairly general in the middle class in Germany, for it appears that the
partisan favour shown everywhere to Luther&rsquo;s writings by the
printers and booksellers gave him an immense propagandist advantage
over his Catholic opponents, who could secure for their replies only
careless or bad workmanship, and were thus made to seem actually
illiterate in the eyes of the reading public.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24077src" href="#xd25e24077" name="xd25e24077src">22</a></p>
<p>As regards Switzerland, again, it is the admitted fact that
&ldquo;the educational movement began before the religious revival, and
was a cause of the Reformation rather than a result.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24085src" href="#xd25e24085" name=
"xd25e24085src">23</a> So in Holland, the Brethren of the Common Lot
(<i lang="la">Fratres Vit&aelig; Communis</i>), a partially communistic
but orthodox order of learned and unlearned laymen which lasted from
the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, did much for the schooling of
the common people, and passed on their impulse to Germany.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24094src" href="#xd25e24094" name=
"xd25e24094src">24</a> Similarly in Scotland the schools seem to have
been fairly numerous even in the later Catholic period.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24106src" href="#xd25e24106" name=
"xd25e24106src">25</a> There, and in some other countries, it was the
main merit of the Reformation to carry on zealously the work so begun,
setting up common schools in every parish. In Lutheran Germany this
work was for a long period much more poorly done, as regarded the
peasantry. These had been trodden down after their revolt into a state
of virtual slavery. &ldquo;The broad midlands and the entire eastern
part of Germany were filled with slaves, who had neither status nor
property nor education&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24121src"
href="#xd25e24121" name="xd25e24121src">26</a> and it was long before
any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>large number of the people were taught to read
and write,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24127src" href="#xd25e24127"
name="xd25e24127src">27</a> the schooling given at the best being a
scanty theological drill.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24130src" href=
"#xd25e24130" name="xd25e24130src">28</a></p>
<p>But indeed for two-thirds of its adherents everywhere the
Reformation meant no other reading than that of the Bible and
catechisms and theological treatises. Coming as it did within one or
two generations of the invention of printing, it stood not for new
ideas, but for the spread of old. That invention had for a time
positively checked the production of new books, the multiplication of
the old having in a measure turned attention to the past;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24135src" href="#xd25e24135" name=
"xd25e24135src">29</a> and the diffusion of the Bible in particular
determined the mental attitude of the movement in mass. The thinking of
its more disinterested promoters began and ended in Bibliolatry: Luther
and Calvin alike did but set up an infallible book and a local tyranny
against an infallible pope and a tyranny centring at Rome. Neither
dreamt of toleration; and Calvin, the more competent mind of the two,
did but weld the detached irrationalities of the current theology into
a system which crushed reason and stultified the morality in the name
of which he ruled Geneva with a rod of iron.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24146src" href="#xd25e24146" name="xd25e24146src">30</a> It is
remarkable that both men reverted to the narrowest orthodoxies of the
earlier Church, in defiance of whatever spirit of reasonable inquiry
had been on the side of their movement. &ldquo;It is a quality of
faith,&rdquo; wrote Luther, &ldquo;that it wrings the neck of reason
and strangles the beast&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24158src"
href="#xd25e24158" name="xd25e24158src">31</a> and he repeatedly avowed
that it was only by submitting his mind absolutely to the Scriptures
that he could retain his faith.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24168src"
href="#xd25e24168" name="xd25e24168src">32</a> &ldquo;He despised
reason as heartily as any papal dogmatist could despise it. He hated
the very thought of toleration or comprehension.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24178src" href="#xd25e24178" name=
"xd25e24178src">33</a> And when Calvin was combated by the Catholic
Pighius on the question of predestination and freewill, his defence was
that he followed Christ and the Apostles, while his opponents resorted
to human thoughts and reasonings.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24185src"
href="#xd25e24185" name="xd25e24185src">34</a> On the same principle he
dealt with the Copernican theory. After once breaking away from Rome
both leaders became typical anti-freethinkers, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name=
"pb440">440</a>]</span>never even making Savonarola&rsquo;s pretence to
resort to rationalist methods, though of course not more
anti-rationalist than he. The more reasonable Zwingli, who tried to put
an intelligible aspect on one or two of the mysteries of the faith, was
scouted by both, as they scouted each other.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Zwingli, the most open-minded of the
Reformers, owed his relative enlightenment to his general humanist
culture,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24198src" href="#xd25e24198" name=
"xd25e24198src">35</a> and in particular to the influence of Pico della
Mirandola and of Erasmus. It has even been argued that his whole
theological system is derived from Pico<span class="corr" id=
"xd25e24206" title="Not in source">,</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24208src" href="#xd25e24208" name="xd25e24208src">36</a> but it
appears to have been from Erasmus that he drew his semi-rationalistic
view of the eucharist,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24220src" href=
"#xd25e24220" name="xd25e24220src">37</a> a development of that of
Berengar, representing it as a simple commemoration. Such thinking was
far from the &ldquo;spirit of the Reformation&rdquo;; and Luther, after
the Colloquy of Marburg (1529), in which he and Melanchthon debated
against Zwingli and Oecolampadius, spoke of those
&ldquo;Sacramentarians&rdquo; as &ldquo;not only liars, but the very
incarnation of lying, deceit, and hypocrisy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e24226src" href="#xd25e24226" name="xd25e24226src">38</a>
Zwingli&rsquo;s language is less ferocious; but it is confessed of him
that he too practised coercion against minorities in the case alike of
the Anabaptists and of the monasteries and nunneries, and even in the
establishment of his reformed eucharist.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24229src" href="#xd25e24229" name="xd25e24229src">39</a> The
expulsion of the nuns of St. Katherinenthal in particular was an act of
sheer tyranny; and the outcome of the methods enforced by him at
Z&uuml;rich was the bitter hostility of the five Forest Cantons, which
remained Catholic. In war with them he lost his life; and after his
death (1531) his sacramental doctrine rapidly disappeared from Swiss
and Continental Protestantism,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24235src"

slain&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang="la">Quare nullo modo possum admittere,
falsos doctores occidi.</i>&rdquo; As early as 1524, renouncing his
previous doctrine of non-coercion, he invoked the intervention of the
State to punish blasphemy, declaring that the power of the sword was
given by God for such ends (Bezold, p. 563). Melanchthon too declared
that &ldquo;Our commands are mere Platonic laws when the civil power
does not give its support&rdquo; (<i>id.</i> p. 565).</p>
<p>A certain intellectual illusion is set up even by Bezold when he
writes that in Luther&rsquo;s resort to physical force &ldquo;the
hierarchical principle had triumphed over one of the noblest principles
of the Reformation.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Reformation&rdquo; had no
specific principles. Among its promoters were professed all manner of
principles. The Reformation was the outcome of all their activities,
and to make of it an entity or even a distinct set of theories is to
obscure the phenomena.</p>
<p>Such flaws of formulation, however, are trifling in comparison with
the mis-statement of the historic fact which is still normal in
academic as in popular accounts of the Reformation. It would be
difficult, for instance, to give seriously a more misleading account of
the Lutheran reformation than the proposition of Dr. Edward Caird that,
&ldquo;in thrusting aside the claim of the Church to place itself
between the individual and God, Luther had proclaimed the emancipation
of men not only from the leading strings of the Church, but, in effect,
from all external authority whatever, and even, in a sense, from all
merely external teaching or revelation of the truth&rdquo;
(<i>Hegel</i>, 1883, p. 18). Luther thrust his own Church precisely
where the Catholic Church had been; bitterly denounced new heresies;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442</a>]</span>and put the Bible determinedly &ldquo;between
the individual and God.&rdquo; In Luther&rsquo;s own day Sebastian
Franck unanswerably accused him of setting up a paper pope in place of
the human pope he had rejected. Luther&rsquo;s declaration was that
&ldquo;the ungodly papists prefer the authority of the Church far above
God&rsquo;s Word, a blasphemy abominable and not to be endured,
wherewith &hellip; they spit in God&rsquo;s face. Truly God&rsquo;s
patience is exceeding great, in that they be not destroyed&rdquo;
(<i>Table Talk</i>, ch. i).</p>
<p>Another misconception is set up by Pattison, who seems to have been
much concerned to shield Calvin from the criticism of the civilized
conscience (see below, p. 452). He pronounces that Calvin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;great merit lies in his comparative neglect of dogma. He seized
the idea of reformation as a real renovation of human character&rdquo;
(<i>Essays</i>, ii, 23). If so, the reformer can have had little
satisfaction, for he never admitted having regenerated Geneva. But the
claim that he &ldquo;comparatively&rdquo; neglected dogma is true only
in the sense that he was more inquisitorially zealous about certain
forms of private conduct than was Luther. Gruet, indeed, he helped to
slay upon political charges, taking a savage vengeance upon a personal
opponent. But even in Gruet&rsquo;s case he sought later to add a
religious justification to his crime. And it was in the name of dogma
that he put Servetus to death, exiled Castalio, imprisoned Bolsec,
broke with old friends, and imperilled the entire Genevan polity.
Pattison&rsquo;s praise would be much more appropriate to Zwingli.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luther, though he would probably have been ready enough to punish
Copernicus as a heretic, was saved the evil chance which befel Calvin
of being put in a place of authority where he could in God&rsquo;s name
commit judicial murder. It is by acts so describable that the name of
Calvin is most directly connected with the history of freethought. In
nowise entitled to rank with its furtherers, he is to be enrolled in
the evil catalogue of its persecutors. In the case of <span class=
"sc">Jacques Gruet</span> on a mixture of political and religious
charges, in that of <span class="sc">Michael Servetus</span> on grounds
of dogma pure and simple, he cast upon the record of Genevan
Protestantism and upon his own memory an ineffaceable stain of blood.
Gruet, an adherent of the Perrinist faction of Geneva, a party opposed
to Calvin, on being arrested for issuing a placard against the clerical
junto in power, was found, by the accounts of the Calvinist historians,
to have among his papers some revealing his disbelief in the Christian
religion.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24336src" href="#xd25e24336" name=
"xd25e24336src">43</a> This, however, proves to be a partisan account
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>matter, and is hardly even in intention
truthful. In the first place, it was admitted by Calvin that the
placard, affixed by night to the chair of St. Peter in Geneva, was not
in Gruet&rsquo;s handwriting; yet he was arrested, imprisoned, and
<i>put to the torture</i> with the avowed object of making him confess
&ldquo;that he had acted at the instigation of Fran&ccedil;ois Favre,
of the wife of Perrin, and of other accomplices of the same party whom
he must have had.&rdquo; Perrin was the former Captain-General of
Geneva, a popular personage, opposed to Calvin and detested by him. No
match for the vigilant Reformer, Perrin had been through Calvin&rsquo;s
intrigues deprived of his post; and there was a standing feud between
his friends and the Calvinistic party in power.</p>
<p>The main part of the charges against Gruet was political; and the
most circumstantial was based upon a draft, found among his papers, of
a speech which he had ostensibly proposed to make in the General
Council calling for reform of abuses. The speech contained nothing
seditious, but the intention to deliver it without official permission
was described as <i lang="fr">l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i>&mdash;a
term now newly introduced into Genevan procedure. The other documentary
proofs were trivial. In one fragment of a letter there was an ironical
mention of &ldquo;notre galant Calvin&rdquo;; and in a note on a margin
of Calvin&rsquo;s book against the Anabaptists he had written in Latin
&ldquo;All trifles.&rdquo; For the rest, he was accused of writing two
pages in Latin &ldquo;in which are comprised several errors,&rdquo; and
of being &ldquo;inclined (<i lang="fr">plut&ocirc;t enclin</i>) to say,
recite and write false opinions and errors as to the true words of Our
Saviour.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24361src" href="#xd25e24361"
name="xd25e24361src">44</a> Concerning his errors the only documentary
proof preserved is from an alleged scrap of his writing in corrupt
Latin, cited by Calvin as a sample of his inability to write Latin
correctly: <i lang="la">Omnes tam humane quam divine que dicantur leges
factae sunt ad placitum hominum</i>, which may be rendered, &ldquo;All
so-called laws, divine as well as human, are made at the will of
men.&rdquo; In the act of sentence, he is declared further to have
written obscene verses justifying free love; to have striven to ruin
the authority of the consistory, menaced the ministers, and abused
Calvin; and to have &ldquo;conspired with the king of France against
the safety of Calvin and the State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make out these charges, for the last of which there seems to be
no evidence whatever, Gruet was put to the torture many times
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>during many days &ldquo;according to the manner
of the time,&rdquo; says one of Calvin&rsquo;s biographers.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24377src" href="#xd25e24377" name=
"xd25e24377src">45</a> In reality such unmeasured use of torture was in
Geneva a Calvinistic innovation. Gruet, refusing under the worst stress
of torture to incriminate anyone else, at length, in order to end it,
pleaded guilty to the charges against him, praying in his last
extremity for a speedy death. On July 26, 1547, his half-dead body was
beheaded on the scaffold, the torso being tied and the feet nailed
thereto. Such were the judicial methods and mercies of a reformed
Christianity, guided by a chief reformer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The biographer Henry &ldquo;cannot repress a
sigh&rdquo; over the thirty days of double torture of Gruet (ii, 66),
but goes on to make a most disingenuous defence of Calvin, first
asserting that he was not responsible, and then arguing that it would
be as unjust to try Calvin by modern standards as to blame him for not
wearing a perruque &agrave; la Louis XIV, or proceeding by the Code
Napol&eacute;on! The same moralist declares (p. 68) that &ldquo;it is
really inspiriting to hear how Calvin stormed in his sermons against
the opposite party&rdquo;: and is profoundly impressed by the
&ldquo;deep religious earnestness&rdquo; with which Calvin in 1550
claimed that &ldquo;The council ought again to declare aloud that this
blasphemer has been justly condemned, that the wrath of God may be
averted from the city.&rdquo; Finally (p. 69), recording how
Gruet&rsquo;s &ldquo;book&rdquo; was burned in 1550, the biographer
pronounces that &ldquo;The Gospel thus <i>gained a victory over its
enemies</i>; in the same manner as in Germany freedom triumphed when
Luther burnt the pope&rsquo;s bull.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the alleged anti-religious writings of Gruet, they were not
produced or even specified till 1550, three years after his execution,
when they were said to have been found partly in the roof of what had
been his house (now occupied by the secretary of the consistory),
partly behind a chimney, and partly in a dustbin. Put together, they
amounted to thirteen leaves, in a handwriting which was declared by
Calvin to be &ldquo;juridically, by good examination of trustworthy
men, recognized to be that of Gruet.&rdquo; The time and the singular
manner of their discovery raises the question whether the papers had
not been placed by the finders. The execution of Gruet, the first
bloodshed under Calvin&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">r&eacute;gime</i>, had
roused new hatred against him; the slain man figured as a martyr in the
eyes of the party to which he belonged; and it had become necessary to
discredit him and them if the ascendancy of Calvin was to be secure. It
is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name=
"pb445">445</a>]</span>solely upon Calvin&rsquo;s account that we have
to depend for our knowledge of Gruet&rsquo;s alleged anti-Christian
doctrine; for the document, after being described and condemned, was
duly burned by the common hangman. If genuine, it was a remarkable
performance. According to the act of condemnation, which is in the
handwriting of Calvin, it derided all religions alike, blasphemed God,
Jesus, the Holy Ghost, the Virgin Mary, Moses, the Patriarchs, the
Prophets, the Apostles, the disciples, the gospels, the Old and New
Testaments, the gospel miracles, and the resurrection.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24394src" href="#xd25e24394" name=
"xd25e24394src">46</a> Not a single phrase is quoted; we have mere
general description, execration, and sentence.</p>
<p>Whether the document was a planned forgery, or part of a copy by
Gruet of an anti-Christian treatise theretofore secretly circulated,
will never be known. The story of Gruet soon swelled into a legend.
According to one narrative, he had copied with his own hand and
circulated in Geneva the mysterious treatise, <i lang="la">De Tribus
Impostoribus</i>, the existence of which, at that period, is very
doubtful.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24405src" href="#xd25e24405" name=

"xd25e24414src">48</a> the <i>Libertines</i> have been sometimes
supposed to be generally unbelievers; but there is no more evidence for
this than for the general ascription to them of licentious conduct. It
appears certain indeed that at that time the name <i>Libertine</i> was
not recognized as a label for all of Calvin&rsquo;s political
opponents, but was properly reserved for the sect so-called;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24424src" href="#xd25e24424" name=
"xd25e24424src">49</a> but even a vindicator of Calvin admits that
&ldquo;it is undeniable that the Libertines [<i>i.e.</i> the political

political representatives of the patriots of 1530.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24433src" href="#xd25e24433" name=
"xd25e24433src">50</a> The presumption is that the political opposition
included the more honest and courageous men of liberal and tolerant

&ldquo;free&rdquo; life.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24439src" href=
"#xd25e24439" name="xd25e24439src">51</a> The really antinomian
<i>Libertini</i> of the period were to be found among the
pantheistic-Christian sect or school so-called, otherwise known as
Spirituals, who seem to have been a branch of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name=
"pb446">446</a>]</span>Brethren of the Free Spirit, or fraternity of
the &ldquo;Spirit of Liberty.&rdquo; These Calvin denounced in his
manner; but in 1544 he had also forced into exile his former friend,
Sebastian Castalio (or Castalion; properly Chatillon), master of the
public school at Geneva, for simply rejecting his doctrine of absolute
predestination, striving to have him driven in turn from Basel; and in
1551 he had caused to be imprisoned and banished a physician and
ex-Carmelite, Jerome Bolsec, for publicly denying the same dogma.
Bolsec, being prevented by Calvin&rsquo;s means from settling in any
neighbouring Protestant community, returned to Catholicism,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24456src" href="#xd25e24456" name=
"xd25e24456src">52</a> as did many others. After Calvin&rsquo;s death
Bolsec took his revenge in an attack on the reformer in his public and
private character,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24462src" href=
"#xd25e24462" name="xd25e24462src">53</a> which has been treated as
untrustworthy by the more moderate Catholic scholars who deal with the
period;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24467src" href="#xd25e24467" name=
"xd25e24467src">54</a> and which, as regards its account of his private
morals, is probably on all fours with Calvin&rsquo;s own unscrupulous
charges against the &ldquo;Libertines&rdquo; and others who opposed
him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The tenets of the <i lang="it">Libertini</i> are
somewhat mystifying, as handled by Calvin and his biographer Henry,
both alike animated by the <i lang="la">odium theologicum</i> in the
highest degree. By Calvin&rsquo;s own account they were mystical
Christians, speaking of Christ as &ldquo;the spirit which is in the
world and in us all,&rdquo; and of the devil and his angels as having
no proper existence, being identical with the world and sin. Further,
they denied the eternity of the human soul and the freedom of the will;
and Calvin charges them with subverting alike belief in God and
morality (Henry, <i>Life of Calvin</i>, Eng. tr. ii, 45&ndash;46). The
last charge could just as validly be brought against his own
predestinarianism; and as regards ethics we find Calvin alternately
denouncing the Libertines for treating all sin as unpardonable, and for
stating that in Christ none could sin. Apparently he gives his
inferences as their doctrines; and the antinomianism which, in the case
of the trial of Madame Ameaux, Henry identifies with pantheism, was by
his own showing of a Christian cast. Little credit, accordingly, can be
given to his summing up that among the Libertines of Geneva there
exhibited itself &ldquo;a perfectly-formed anti-Christianity,&rdquo;
which he calls &ldquo;a true offspring of hell&rdquo; (ii, 49). The
residuum of truth appears to be that in the pantheism of this sect, as
Neander says concerning the Brethren of the Free Spirit among the
Beghards, there were &ldquo;the <i>foretokens</i> of a thoroughly
anti-Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name=
"pb447">447</a>]</span>tendency, hostile to everything supernatural,
every sentiment of a God above the world; a tendency which contained
&hellip; the germ of absolute rationalism&rdquo; (<i>Hist. of the Chr.
Church</i>, Torrey&rsquo;s tr. ix, 536). Pantheism, logically extended,
obviously reduces the supernatural and the natural to unity, and is
thus atheistic. But that the pantheists of Geneva in Calvin&rsquo;s day
reached logical consistency is incredible. The Libertine sect, in all
likelihood, was only partially antinomian, and only in very small part
consciously anti-Christian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this period (1552), on the same issue of predestination, Calvin
broke utterly with one of his closest friends, Jacques de Bourgogne,
Sieur de Falais.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24494src" href=
"#xd25e24494" name="xd25e24494src">55</a> It seemed as if the
Protestant polity were disrupting in a continuous convulsion of
dogmatic strife; and Melanchthon wrote to Bucer in despair over the
madness and misery of a time in which Geneva was returning to the
fatalism of the Stoics, and imprisoning whosoever would not agree with
Zeno.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24497src" href="#xd25e24497" name=
"xd25e24497src">56</a> By this time it must have been clear to some
that behind the strifes of raging theologians there lay a philosophic
problem which they could not sound. It is therefore not surprising to
learn that already Basel University, as fifty years before at Erfurt,
there was a latitudinarian group of professors who aimed at a universal
religion, and came near &ldquo;naturalism&rdquo; in the
attempt;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24509src" href="#xd25e24509" name=
"xd25e24509src">57</a> while elsewhere in Switzerland, as we shall see
later, there grew up the still freer way of thought which came to be
known as Deism.</p>
<p>A great impulse to that development, as well as to simple
Unitarianism, must have been given by the execution of Michael
Servetus.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24514src" href="#xd25e24514" name=
"xd25e24514src">58</a> That ill-starred heretic, born of Spanish stock
in France, brought to the propaganda of Unitarianism, of which he may
be reckoned the inaugurator, a determination as strong as
Calvin&rsquo;s own. Sent by his father to study civil law at Toulouse,
he began there to study the Bible, doubtless under the stimulus of the
early Protestant discussions of the time. The result was a prompt
advance beyond the Protestant standpoint. Leaving Toulouse after two or
three years&rsquo; residence, he visited Bologna and Augsburg in the
train of the confessor of Charles V. Thereafter he visited Lyons and
Geneva, and had some intercourse with Oecolampadius <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name="pb448">448</a>]</span>at
Basel, where he put in the hands of a bookseller the signed manuscript
of his first book, <i lang="la">De Trinitatis erroribus libri
septem</i>. The bookseller sent it on to Hagenau, in Alsace, which as
an &ldquo;imperial city&rdquo; seems to have had special freedom in the
matter of book-publishing; and thither, after visiting Bucer and Capito
at Strasburg, Servetus went to have it printed in 1531.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24522src" href="#xd25e24522" name=
"xd25e24522src">59</a> In this treatise, produced in his twenty-first
year, he definitely rejects Trinitarianism, while putting somewhat
obscurely his own idea of the nature of Jesus Christ&mdash;whom, it
should be noted, he held in high reverence. In the following year he
produced at the same place another small treatise, <i lang=
"la">Dialogorum de Trinitate libri duo</i>, wherein he recasts his
first work, &ldquo;retracting&rdquo; it and apologizing for its
crudity, but standing substantially to its positions. It was not till
1553 that he printed at Vienne in Dauphin&eacute;, without his name,
his <i lang="la">Christianismi Restitutio</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24538src" href="#xd25e24538" name="xd25e24538src">60</a> In the
interval he had been doing scientific work as an editor of Ptolemy
(1535, Lyons), and as a student of and lecturer on anatomy and medicine
at Paris, where (1536) he met Calvin on his last visit to France. In
1538 he is found studying at Louvain; and, after practising medicine at
Avignon and Charlieu, he again studies medicine at Montpellier. The
Archbishop of Vienne, who had heard him lecture at Paris, established
him at Vienne as his confidential physician (1541&ndash;53), and there
it was that he produced the book for which he died. About 1545&ndash;46
he had rashly written to Calvin, sending him the MS. of the
much-expanded recast of his books which later appeared as the <i lang=
"la">Restitutio</i>. Calvin sent a hostile reply, and on the same day
wrote to Farel: &ldquo;If he come, and my influence can avail, I shall
not suffer him to depart alive.&rdquo; Servetus had denounced the
papacy as fiercely as any Protestant could wish, yet his heresy on the
question of the Trinity<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24546src" href=
"#xd25e24546" name="xd25e24546src">61</a> was enough to doom him to
instant death at Calvin&rsquo;s hands. Servetus could not get back his
MS., and wrote to a friend about 1547 that he felt sure the affair
would bring him to his death.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24552src"
href="#xd25e24552" name="xd25e24552src">62</a> When in 1552&ndash;53 he
had the book privately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href=
"#pb449" name="pb449">449</a>]</span>printed at Vienne, and the bulk of
the edition was sent to Lyons and Frankfort, the toils closed around
him, the ecclesiastical authorities at Lyons being apprised of the
facts by de Trie, a Genevan Protestant, formerly of Lyons. The whole
Protestant world, in fact, was of one opinion in desiring to suppress
Servetus&rsquo;s anti-Trinitarian books, and the wonder is that he had
so long escaped both Protestant and Catholic fury. Luther had called
his first book horribly wicked; and Melanchthon, who in 1533 foresaw
from the second much dangerous debate, wrote in 1539 to the Venetian
Senate to warn them against letting either be sold.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e24558src" href="#xd25e24558" name="xd25e24558src">63</a> It is
significant of the random character of Protestant as of Catholic
thought that Servetus, like Melanchthon, was a convinced believer in
astrology,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24572src" href="#xd25e24572"
name="xd25e24572src">64</a> while Luther on Biblical grounds rejected
astrology and the Copernican astronomy alike, and held devoutly by the
belief in witchcraft. The superiority of Servetus consists in his real
scientific work&mdash;he having in part given out the true doctrine of
the circulation of the blood<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24578src" href=
"#xd25e24578" name="xd25e24578src">65</a>&mdash;and his objection to
all persecution of heresy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24587src" href=
"#xd25e24587" name="xd25e24587src">66</a> Philosophically, he was more
than a mere Scripturist. Though pantheism was not charged upon him, we
have Calvin&rsquo;s testimony that he propounded it in the strongest
form.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24590src" href="#xd25e24590" name=
"xd25e24590src">67</a></p>
<p>Calvin&rsquo;s guilt in the matter begins with his devices to have
Servetus seized by the Catholic authorities of Lyons<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e24598src" href="#xd25e24598" name=
"xd25e24598src">68</a>&mdash;to set misbelievers, as he regarded them,
to slay the misbeliever&mdash;and his use of Servetus&rsquo;s
confidential letters against him.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24612src"
href="#xd25e24612" name="xd25e24612src">69</a> He was not repelling a
heresy from his own city, but heretic-hunting far away in sheer
malignity. The Catholics were the less cruel gaolers, and let their
prisoner escape, condemning him to death at Vienne in absence. After
some months of wandering he had the temerity to seek to pass into Italy
by way of Geneva, and was there at length recognized, and arrested.
After a long trial he was sentenced to be burned alive (Oct. 27, 1553).
The trial at Geneva is a classic document in the records of the
cruelties committed in honour of chimeras; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name=
"pb450">450</a>]</span>Calvin&rsquo;s part is the sufficient proof that
the Protestant could hold his own with the Catholic Inquisitor in the
spirit of hate.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24617src" href="#xd25e24617"
name="xd25e24617src">70</a> It has been urged, in his excuse, that the
doctrines of Servetus were blasphemously put; but in point of fact
Calvin passed some of his bitterest denunciation on the statement,
cited (from Lorenz Friese) in a note in Servetus&rsquo;s edition of
Ptolemy&rsquo;s <i>Geography</i>, that Judea is actually a barren and
meagre country, and not &ldquo;flowing with milk and honey.&rdquo;
Despite the citation of ample proof, and the plea that the passage was
drawn from a previous edition, it was by Calvin adjudged blasphemous in
that it &ldquo;necessarily inculpated Moses and grievously outraged the
Holy Spirit.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24636src" href=
"#xd25e24636" name="xd25e24636src">71</a> The language of Calvin
against Servetus at this point is utterly furious. Had Servetus chanced
to maintain the doctrine of the earth&rsquo;s motion, he would
certainly have been adjudged a blasphemer on that score also; for in
the Argument to his <i>Commentary on Genesis</i> (1563) Calvin doggedly
maintains the Ptolemaic theory. His language tells of much private
freethinking around him on the Mosaic doctrine, and his tone leaves no
doubt as to how he would treat published heresy on that theme. The
audacity of Servetus in suggesting that the 53rd chapter of Isaiah had
historical reference to Cyrus is for him anathema.<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e24654src" href="#xd25e24654" name="xd25e24654src">72</a></p>
<p>Even before this hideous episode, Calvin&rsquo;s passion of
malevolence against his theological opponents in his own sect is such
as to shock some of his adoring biographers.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24662src" href="#xd25e24662" name="xd25e24662src">73</a> All the
Protestant leaders, broadly speaking, grew more intolerant as they grew
in years&mdash;a fair test as between the spirit of dogma and the
spirit of freethought. Calvin had begun by pleading for tolerance and
clemency; Luther, beginning as a humanitarian, soon came to be capable
of hounding on the German nobility against the unhappy peasants;
Melanchthon, tolerant in his earlier days, applauded the burning of
Servetus;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24668src" href="#xd25e24668" name=
"xd25e24668src">74</a> Beza laboriously defended the act. Erasmus stood
for tolerance; and Luther accordingly called him godless, an enemy of
true religion, a slanderer of Christ, a Lucian, an Epicurean, and (by
implication) the greatest knave alive.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The burning of Servetus in 1553, however, marked a turning point in
Protestant theological practice on the Continent. There were still to
come the desperate religious wars in France, in which more than 300,000
houses were destroyed, abominable savageries were committed, and all
civilization was thrown back, both materially and morally; and there
was yet to come the still more appalling calamity of the Thirty
Years&rsquo; War in Germany&mdash;a result of the unstable political
conditions set up at the Reformation; but theological human sacrifices
were rapidly discredited. Servetus was not the first victim, but he was
nearly the last.</p>
<p>The jurist Matthieu Gripaldi (or Gribaldo) lectured on law at
Toulouse, Cahors, Valence, and Padua successively, and, finding his
anti-Trinitarian leanings everywhere a source of danger to him, had
sought a retreat at Fargias near Geneva, then in the jurisdiction of
Berne. Venturing to remonstrate with Calvin against the sentence on
Servetus, he brought upon himself the angry scrutiny of the
heretic-hunter, and was banished from the neighbourhood. For a time he
found refuge in a new professorship at T&uuml;bingen; but there too the
alarm was raised, and he was expelled. Coming back to Fargias, he gave
refuge to the heretic Valentinus Gentilis on his escape from Geneva;
and again Calvin attacked him, delivering him to the authorities of
Berne. An abjuration saved him for the time; but he would probably have
met the martyr&rsquo;s fate in time had not his death by the plague, in
1564, guaranteed him, as Bayle remarks, against any further trial for
heresy.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24693src" href="#xd25e24693" name=

<blockquote>
<p class="first">The effect of theological bias on moral judgment is
interestingly exemplified in the comment of Mosheim on the case of
Servetus. Unable to refer to the beliefs of deists or atheists without
vituperation, Mosheim finds it necessary to add to his account of
Servetus as a highly-gifted and very learned man the qualification:
&ldquo;Yet he laboured under no small moral defects, for he was beyond
all measure arrogant, and at the same time ill-tempered, contentious,
unyielding, and a semi-fanatic.&rdquo; Every one of these
characterizations is applicable in the highest degree to Calvin, and in
a large degree to Luther; yet for them the historian has not a word of
blame.</p>
<p>Even among rationalists it has not been uncommon to make light of
Calvin&rsquo;s crimes on the score that his energy maintained a polity
which alone sustained Protestantism against the Catholic Reaction. This
is the verdict of Michelet: &ldquo;The Renaissance, betrayed by the
accident of the mobilities of France, turning to the wind of light
volitions, would assuredly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href=
"#pb452" name="pb452">452</a>]</span>have perished, and the world would
have fallen into the great net of the fishers of men, but for that
supreme concentration of the Reformation on the rock of Geneva by the
bitter genius of Calvin.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;Against the immense
and darksome net into which Europe fell by the abandonment of France
nothing less than this heroic seminary could avail&rdquo; (<i lang=
"fr">Hist. de France</i>, vol. x, <i lang="fr">La R&eacute;forme</i>:
end of pref. and end of vol.). Though this verdict has been accepted by
such critical thinkers as Pattison (<i>Essays</i>, ii, 30&ndash;32) and
Lord Morley (Romanes Lecture on <i>Machiavelli</i>, 1877, p. 47), it is
difficult to find for it any justification in history.</p>
<p>The nature of the proposition is indeed far from clear. Michelet
appears to mean that Geneva saved Europe as constituting a political
rallying-point, a nucleus for Protestantism. Pattison, pronouncing that
&ldquo;Calvinism saved Europe&rdquo; (<i>Essays</i>, ii, 32), explains
that it was by &ldquo;a positive education of the individual
soul&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;this, and this alone, enabled the
Reformation to make head against the terrible repressive forces brought
to bear by Spain&mdash;the Inquisition and the Jesuits&rdquo; (p. 32).
The thesis thus vanishes in rhetoric, for it is quite impossible to
give such a formula any significance in the light of the history of
Protestantism in Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, and Holland. It implies
that where Protestantism finally failed&mdash;as in Italy, France,
Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, Belgium, parts of Germany, and parts of
Switzerland&mdash;it was because the individual spirit had not been
educated enough, which is a mere omission to note the real economic and
political causation. Neither Michelet nor Pattison had any scientific
notion of the nature of the process.</p>
<p>If we revert to Michelet&rsquo;s claim, we get no more satisfaction.
The very fact that Calvin&rsquo;s polity could subsist without any
special military protection is the proof that it could have subsisted
without the gross cruelty and systematic persecution which marked it
out from the rest of the world, making Geneva &ldquo;a kind of frozen
hell of austerity and retribution and secret sin.&rdquo; To say
otherwise is to say that freedom and toleration are less attractive to
men than ferocity, tyranny, and gloom. Calvin drove many men back to
Catholicism, and had his full share in the mortal schism which set
Calvinists and Lutherans at daggers drawn for a century, while
Catholicism re-conquered Poland and Bohemia and Hungary, held France,
and nearly re-conquered Lutheran Germany. There is no reason to suppose
that the Reformation would have gone otherwise in Britain, Scandinavia,
and Holland had Geneva gone as far in tolerance as it actually did in
intolerance. To call it, as Michelet does, an &ldquo;asylum,&rdquo; in
view of Calvin&rsquo;s expulsion or execution of every man who dared to
differ from him, is courageous.</p>
<p>At the close of his argument (p. 41) Pattison sums up that,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span>&ldquo;Greatly as the Calvinistic Churches have
served the cause of political liberty, they have contributed nothing to
the cause of knowledge.&rdquo; The admission is in the main valid; but
the claim will not stand, unless &ldquo;political liberty&rdquo; is to
be newly defined. The Calvinistic rule at Geneva was from the first a
class tyranny, which became more and more narrow in its social basis.
The Calvinist clergy and populace of Holland turned their backs on
republican institutions, and became violent monarchists. The Calvinists
of England and Scotland were as determined persecutors as ever lived.
And, indeed, how should liberty anywhere flourish when knowledge is
trodden under foot?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treatment of Bernardino Ochino, who had turned Protestant after
being vicar-general of the Capuchin order, shows the slackening of
ferocity after the end of Servetus. Ochino in a late writing ventured
guardedly to suggest certain relaxations of the law of monogamy&mdash;a
point on which some Lutherans went much further than he&mdash;and was
besides mildly heretical about the Trinity.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24739src" href="#xd25e24739" name="xd25e24739src">77</a> He was
in consequence expelled with his family from the canton of Z&uuml;rich
(1563), at the age of seventy-six. Finding Switzerland wholly
inhospitable, and being driven by the Catholics from Poland, where he
had sought to join the Socinians, he went to die in Moravia.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24745src" href="#xd25e24745" name=
"xd25e24745src">78</a> This was no worse treatment than Lutherans and
Calvinists normally meted out to each other;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24751src" href="#xd25e24751" name="xd25e24751src">79</a> and
several of the Italian Protestants settled at Geneva who leant to
Unitarian views&mdash;among them Gribaldo, Biandrata, and
Alciati&mdash;found it prudent to leave that fortress of orthodoxy,
where they were open to official challenge.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24760src" href="#xd25e24760" name="xd25e24760src">80</a> Finally,
when the Italian Valentinus Gentilis, or Gentile, the anti-Trinitarian,
variously described as Tritheist, Deist, and Arian, uttered his
heresies at Geneva, he contrived, after an imprisonment, a forced
recantation, and a public degradation (1558), to escape thence with his
life, but was duly beheaded at Berne in 1566, refusing this time to
recant.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24763src" href="#xd25e24763" name=

<p>This ends the main Swiss era of theological murder; but a century
was to pass before sectarian hatreds subsided, or the spirit of
persecution was brought under control of civilization. In 1632, indeed,
a Protestant minister, Nicholas Anthoine, was burned at Geneva on the
charge of apostasy to Judaism. As he had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name=
"pb454">454</a>]</span>admittedly insane for a time, and had repeatedly
shown much mental excitement,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24776src"
href="#xd25e24776" name="xd25e24776src">82</a> his execution tells of a
spirit of cruelty worthy of the generation of Calvin. The Protestant
Bibliolatry, in short, was as truly the practical negation of
freethought and tolerance as was Catholicism itself; and it was only
their general remoteness from each other that kept the different
reformed communities from absolute war where they were not, as in
Switzerland, held in check by the dangers around them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24787src" href="#xd25e24787" name=
"xd25e24787src">83</a> As it was, they had their full share in the
responsibility for the furious civil wars which so long convulsed
France, and for those which ultimately reduced Germany to the verge of
destruction, arresting her civilization for over a hundred years.</p>
<p>To sum up. In Germany Protestantism failed alike as a moral and as
an intellectual reform. The lack of any general moral motive in the
ecclesiastical revolution is sufficiently proved by the general
dissolution of conduct which, on the express admission of Luther,
followed upon it.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24792src" href=
"#xd25e24792" name="xd25e24792src">84</a> This was quite apart from the
special disorders of the Anabaptist movement, which, on the other hand,
contained elements of moral and religious rationalism, as against
Bibliolatry, that have been little recognized.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24806src" href="#xd25e24806" name="xd25e24806src">85</a> Of that
movement the summing-up is that, like the Lutheran, it turned to evil
because of sheer lack of rationalism. Among its earlier leaders were
men such as Denk, morally and temperamentally on a higher plane than
any of the Lutherans. But Anabaptism too was fundamentally scriptural
and revelationist, not rational; and it miscarried in its own way even
more hopelessly than the theological &ldquo;reform.&rdquo; Lutheranism,
renouncing the rational and ethical hope of social betterment, ran to
insane dissension over irrational dogma; Anabaptism, ignorantly
attaching the hope of social betterment to religious delusion, ran to
irrational social schemes, ending in anarchy, massacre, and extinction.
But the Lutheran failure was intellectually and morally no less
complete. Luther was with good reason ill at ease about his cause when
he died in 1546; and Melanchthon, dying in 1560, declared himself glad
to be set free from the <i lang="la">rabies theologorum</i>.<a class=

<p>The test of the new regimen lay, if anywhere, in the University of
Wittemberg; and there matters were no better than anywhere <span class=

"#xd25e24825" name="xd25e24825src">87</a> German university life in
general went from bad to worse till a new culture began slowly to
germinate after the Thirty Years&rsquo; War;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24828src" href="#xd25e24828" name="xd25e24828src">88</a> and the
germs came mainly from the neighbouring nations. German Switzerland
exhibited similar symptoms, the Reformation being followed by no free
intellectual life, but by a tyranny identical in spirit and method with
that of Rome.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24833src" href="#xd25e24833"
name="xd25e24833src">89</a> It rests, finally, on the express testimony
of leading Reformers that the main effect of the Reformation in the
intellectual life of Germany was to discredit all disinterested
learning and literature. Melanchthon in particular, writing at dates as
far apart as 1522 and 1557, repeatedly and emphatically testifies to
the utter disregard of erudition and science in the interests of
pietism, corroborating everything said to the same effect by
Erasmus.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24842src" href="#xd25e24842" name=
"xd25e24842src">90</a></p>
<p>On the social and political side the rule of the Protestant princes
was not only as tyrannous but as indecorous as that of their Catholic
days, each playing pope in his own dominions;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24847src" href="#xd25e24847" name="xd25e24847src">91</a> and
their clergy were not in a position to correct them. Menzel notes that
the normal drunkenness of the Protestant aristocracy at this period
made current in Europe the expression &ldquo;a German swine.&rdquo; And
whereas Germany before the Reformation was at various points a culture
force for Europe&mdash;whence the readiness in other nations at first
to follow the Lutheran lead&mdash;it progressively became more and more
of an object-lesson of the evils of heresy, thus fatally weakening the
cause of Protestantism in France, where its fortunes hung in the
balance.</p>
<p>Even in the matter of theology, Protestantism did not hold its own
against Catholic criticism. Both began by discriminating in the
scriptural canon, rejecting some books and depreciating others, all the
while professing to make the Word of God their sole or final standard.
When the Catholics pressed the demand as to how they could settle what
was the true Word of God, their followers and successors could make no
answer, and had to fall back on an indiscriminate acceptance of the
Canon. Again, Luther and Calvin alike maintained the doctrine of
&ldquo;Assurance,&rdquo; and this was one of the points in Calvinism
accepted by Arminius. The Catholics, naturally making the most of the
admitted increase of sexual and other licence in Germany and elsewhere
under Lutheranism, dwelt upon Luther&rsquo;s predestinarianism in
general, and the doctrine of Assurance in particular, as the source of
the demoralization; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href=
"#pb456" name="pb456">456</a>]</span>at the Council of Trent it was
expressly condemned. Thereafter, though it was &ldquo;part and parcel
of the Confessions of all the Churches of the Reformation down to the
Westminster Assembly,&rdquo; it was in the last-named conclave (1643)
declared not to be of the essence of faith; and the Scottish General
Assembly subsequently deposed and condemned holders of this, the
original Protestant doctrine. Similar modifications took place
elsewhere. Thus the Protestant world drifted back to a Catholic
position, affirmed at the Council of Trent against
Protestantism;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24857src" href="#xd25e24857"
name="xd25e24857src">92</a> and in Holland we shall see, in the rise of
Arminianism, a similar surrender on the Protestant side to the general
pressure of Catholicism upon the ethical weaknesses of
Predestinarianism. On that point, however, the original Catholic
doctrine of predestination was revived by the Spanish Jesuit Luis
Molina (1535&ndash;1600; not to be confused with the later Quietist,
Miguel de Molinos), who in his treatise <i lang="la">Liberi Arbitrii
concordia cum grati&aelig; donis</i> (1588) set it forth as consequent
upon God&rsquo;s foreknowledge of man&rsquo;s free use of his will. As
a result of the dispute between the Thomists and Molina&rsquo;s
followers, known as the Molinists, the Pope in 1607 pronounced that the
views of both sides were permissible&mdash;a course which had already
been taken twenty years before with the controversy on predestination
aroused by the doctrines of Michael Baius at the University of
Louvain.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24869src" href="#xd25e24869" name=
"xd25e24869src">93</a> Thus the dissensions of Catholics in a manner
kept in countenance the divided Protestants; but the old confidence of
affirmation and formulation was inevitably sapped by the constant play
of controversy; and from this Protestantism necessarily suffered
most.</p>
<p>Intellectually, there was visible retrogression in the Protestant
world. It is significant that throughout the sixteenth century most of
the great scientific thinkers and the freethinkers with the strongest
bent to new science lived in the Catholic world. Rabelais and Bruno
were priests; Copernicus a lay canon; Galileo had never withdrawn from
the Church which humiliated him; even Kepler returned to the Catholic
environment after professing Protestantism. He was in fact
excommunicated by the T&uuml;bingen Protestant authorities in
1612<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24877src" href="#xd25e24877" name=
"xd25e24877src">94</a> for condemning the Lutheran doctrine that the
body of Christ could be in several places at once. The immunity of such
original spirits as Gilbert and Harriott from active molestation is to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb457" href="#pb457" name=
"pb457">457</a>]</span>be explained only by the fact that they lived in
the as yet un-Puritanized atmosphere of Elizabethan England, before the
age of Bibliolatry. It would seem as if the spirit of Scripturalism,
invading the very centres of thought, were more fatal to original
intellectual life than the more external interferences of Catholic
sacerdotalism.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24899src" href="#xd25e24899"
name="xd25e24899src">95</a> In the phrase of Arnold, Protestantism
turned the key on the spirit, where Catholicism was normally content
with an outward submission to its ceremonies, and only in the most
backward countries, as Spain, destroyed entirely the atmosphere of free
mental intercourse. It was after a long reaction that Bruno and Galileo
were arraigned at Rome.</p>
<p>The clerical resistance to new science, broadly speaking, was more
bitter in the Protestant world than in the Catholic; and it was merely
the relative lack of restraining power in the former that made possible
the later scientific progress. The history of Lutheranism upon this
side is an intellectual infamy. At Wittemberg, during Luther&rsquo;s
life, Reinhold did not dare to teach the Copernican astronomy; Rheticus
had to leave the place in order to be free to speak; and in 1571 the
subject was put in the hands of Peucer, who taught that the Copernican
theory was absurd. Finally, the rector of the university, Hensel, wrote
a text-book for schools, entitled <i>The Restored Mosaic System of the
World</i>, showing with entire success that the new doctrine was
unscriptural.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24918src" href="#xd25e24918"
name="xd25e24918src">96</a> A little later the Lutheran superintendent,
Pfeiffer, of <span class="corr" id="xd25e24921" title=
"Source: Lubeck">L&uuml;beck</span>, published his <i lang=

entire Genesaic myth.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e24927src" href=
"#xd25e24927" name="xd25e24927src">97</a> In the next century Calovius
(1612&ndash;1686), who taught successively at K&ouml;nigsberg, Dantzic,
and Wittemberg, maintained the same position, contending that the story
of Joshua&rsquo;s staying the sun and moon refuted Copernicus.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e24933src" href="#xd25e24933" name=
"xd25e24933src">98</a> When Pope Gregory XIII, following an impulse
abnormal in his world, took the bold step of rectifying the Calendar
(1584), the Protestants in Germany and Switzerland vehemently resisted

id="xd25e24938src" href="#xd25e24938" name="xd25e24938src">99</a> thus
refusing, on theological grounds, the one species of co-operation with

persisted for over a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458"

Geneva, J.-A. Turretin (1671&ndash;1737), writing after Kepler and
Newton had done their work, laboriously repeated the demonstration of
Calovius, and reaffirmed the positions of Calvin. So far as its
ministers could avail, the Sacred Book was working the old effect.</p>

<p class="first">Freethought gained permanently as little in England as
elsewhere in the process of substituting local tyranny for that of
Rome. The secularizing effect of the Reformation, indeed, was even more
marked there than elsewhere. What Wolsey had aimed at doing with
moderation and without revolution was done after him with violence on
motives of sheer plunder, and a multitude not only of monasteries but
of churches were disendowed and destroyed. The monastic churches were
often magnificent, and &ldquo;when the monasteries were dissolved,
divine service altogether ceased in ninety out of every hundred of
these great churches, and the remaining ten were left &hellip; without
any provision whatever&rdquo; for public worship.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24962src" href="#xd25e24962" name="xd25e24962src">100</a> All
this must have had a secularizing effect, which was accentuated by the
changes in ritual; and by the middle of the century it was common to
treat both churches and clergy with utter irreverence, which indeed the
latter often earned by their mode of life.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24971src" href="#xd25e24971" name="xd25e24971src">101</a> Riots
in churches, especially in London, were common; there was in fact a
habit of driving mules and horses through them;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e24977src" href="#xd25e24977" name="xd25e24977src">102</a> and
buying and selling and even gaming were often carried on. But with all
this there was no intellectual enlightenment, and in high places there
was no toleration. Under Henry VIII anti-Romanist heretics were put to
death on the old Romanist principles. In 1532, again, was burned James
Bainham, who not only rejected the specially Catholic dogmas, but
affirmed the possible salvation of unbelievers.</p>
<p>Under the Protectorate which followed there was indeed much
religious semi-rationalism, evidently of continental derivation, which
is discussed in the theological literature of the time. Roger
Hutchinson, writing about 1550, repeatedly speaks of contemporary
&ldquo;Sadducees and Libertines&rdquo; who say (1) &ldquo;that all
spirits and angels are no substances, but inspirations, affections, and
qualities&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;that the devil is nothing but
<i>nolitum</i>, or a filthy affection coming of the flesh&rdquo;; (3)
&ldquo;that there is neither place of rest nor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459" name="pb459">459</a>]</span>pain
after this life; that hell is nothing else but a tormenting and
desperate conscience; and that a joyful, quiet, and merry conscience is
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">See <i>The Image of God, or Layman&rsquo;s Book</i>,
1550, ch. xxiv: Parker Society&rsquo;s rep. 1842, pp. 134, 138, 140.
Cp. p. 79 and Sermon II, on The Lord&rsquo;s Supper (<i>id.</i> p.
247), as to &ldquo;Julianites&rdquo; who &ldquo;do think mortal
<i>corpo</i>, mortal <i>anima</i>.&rdquo; To the period 1550&ndash;60
is also assigned the undated work of John Veron, <i>A Frutefull
Treatise of Predestination and of the Divine Providence of God, with an
Apology of the same against the swynishe gruntinge of the Epicures and
Atheystes of oure time</i>. There was evidently a good deal of new
rationalism, which has been generally ignored in English
historiography. Its foreign source is suggested by the use of the term
&ldquo;Libertines,&rdquo; which derives from France and Geneva. See
below, p. 473. The above-cited tenets are, in fact, partly identical
with those of the <i>libertins</i> denounced at Geneva by Calvin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such doctrine, which we shall find in vogue fifty years later,
cannot have been printed, and probably can have been uttered only by
men of good status, as well as culture; and even by them only because
of the weakness of the State Church in its transition stage. Yet heresy
went still further among some of the sects set up by the Anabaptist
movement, which in England as in Germany involved some measure of
Unitarianism. A letter of Hooper to Bullinger in 1549 tells of
&ldquo;libertines and wretches who are daring enough in their
conventicles not only to deny that Christ is the Messiah and Saviour of
the world, but also to call that blessed Seed a mischievous fellow and
deceiver of the world.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25012src"
href="#xd25e25012" name="xd25e25012src">103</a> This must have been
said with locked doors, for much milder heresy was heavily punished,
the worst penalties falling upon that which stood equally with
orthodoxy on Biblical grounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">In 1541, under Henry VIII, were burned three persons
&ldquo;because they denied transubstantiation, and had not received the
sacrament at Easter.&rdquo; See the letter of Hilles to Bullinger,
<i>Original Letters</i>, as cited, i, 200. The case of Jean Bouchier or
Bocher, burned in 1550, is well known. It is worth noting that the
common charge against Cranmer, of persuading the young king to sign her
death warrant, is false, being one of the myths of Foxe. The warrant
was passed by the whole Privy Council, Cranmer not being even present.
See the Parker Society&rsquo;s reprint of Roger Hutchinson, 1812,
introd. pp. ii-5. Hutchinson apparently approved; and it is significant
of the clerical attitude of the time that he calls (<i>Image of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb460" href="#pb460" name=
"pb460">460</a>]</span>God</i>, ch. xxx, p. 201) for the punishment of
Anabaptists by death if necessary, but does <i>not</i> suggest it for
&ldquo;Sadducees and Libertines.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Elizabethan archbishops and the Puritans were equally
intolerant; and the idea of free inquiry was undreamt of. That there
had been much private discussion in clerical circles, however, is plain
from the 13th and 18th of the Thirty-nine Articles (1562), which
repudiate natural morality and hold &ldquo;accursed&rdquo; those who
say that men can be saved under any creed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25034src" href="#xd25e25034" name="xd25e25034src">104</a> This
fulmination would not have occurred had the heresy not been pressing;
but the &ldquo;curse&rdquo; would thenceforth set the key of clerical
and public utterance. The Reformation, in fact, speedily over-clouded
with fanaticism what new light of freethought had been glimmering
before; turning into Bibliolaters those who had rationally doubted some
of the Catholic mysteries, and forcing back, either into silence or, by
reaction, into Catholic bigotry, those more refined spirits who, like
Sir Thomas More, had before been really in advance of their age
intellectually and morally, and desired a transmutation of the old
system rather than its overthrow. Nothing so nearly rational as the
<i>Utopia</i> (1515&ndash;16) appeared again in English literature for
a century; it is indeed, in some respects, a lead to social science in
our own day. More, with all his spontaneous turn for pietism, had
evidently drunk in his youth or prime<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25046src" href="#xd25e25046" name="xd25e25046src">105</a> at some
freethinking source, for his book recognizes the existence of
unbelievers in deity and immortality; and though he pronounces them
unfit for political power, as did Milton, Locke, and Voltaire long
after him, he stipulates that they be tolerated.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25052src" href="#xd25e25052" name="xd25e25052src">106</a> Broadly
speaking, the book is simply deistic. &ldquo;From a world,&rdquo; says
a popular historian, clerically trained&mdash;&ldquo;from a world where
fifteen hundred years of Christian teaching had produced social
injustice, religious intolerance, and political tyranny, the humorist
philosopher turns to a &lsquo;Nowhere&rsquo; in which the efforts of
mere natural human virtue realized those ends of security, equality,
brotherhood, and freedom, for which the very institution of society
seems to have been framed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25055src"
href="#xd25e25055" name="xd25e25055src">107</a> In his own case,
however, we see the Nemesis of the sway of feeling over <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb461" href="#pb461" name=
"pb461">461</a>]</span>judgment, for, beginning by keeping his
prejudice above the reason of whose teaching he is conscious, he ends
by becoming a blind religious polemist and a bitter persecutor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Cp. Isaac Disraeli&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;The
Psychological Character of Sir Thomas More,&rdquo; in the <i>Amenities
of Literature</i>, and the present writer&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;Culture
and Reaction,&rdquo; in <i>Essays in Sociology</i>, vol. i. Lord Acton,
vindicating More as against Wolsey, pleads (<i>Histor. Essays and
Studies</i>, 1907, p. 64) that More before his death protested that no
Protestant perished by his act. This seems to be true in the bare sense
that he did not exceed his ostensible legal duties, and several times
restrained the execution of the law (Archdeacon Hutton, <i>Sir Thomas
More</i>, 1895, pp. 215&ndash;22). But the fact remains that More
expressly justified and advocated the burning of heretics as
&ldquo;lawful, necessary, and well done.&rdquo; Title of ch. xiii of
Dialogue, <i>The Supper of the Lord</i>. Cp. title of ch. xv.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is in the wake, then, of the overthrow of Catholicism in the
second generation that a far-reaching freethought begins to be heard of
in England; and this clearly comes by way of new continental and
literary contact, which would have occurred in at least as great a
degree under Catholicism, save insofar as unbelief was facilitated by
the irreverence developed by the ecclesiastical revolution, or by the
state of indifference which among the upper classes was the natural
sequel of the shameless policy of plunder and the oscillation between
Protestant and Catholic forms. And it was finally in such negative ways
only that Protestantism furthered freethought anywhere.</p>

<h3 class="main">&sect; 3. <i>The Netherlands</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hardly more fortunate was the earlier course of things
intellectual after the Reformation in the Netherlands, where by the
fifteenth century remarkable progress had been made alike in science
and the arts, and where Erasmus acquired his culture and did his
service to culture&rsquo;s cause. The fact that Protestantism had to
fight for its life against Philip was of course not the fault of the
Protestants; and to that ruinous struggle is to be attributed the
arrest of the civilization of Flanders. But it lay in the nature of the
Protestant impulse that, apart from the classical culture which in
Holland was virtually a successful industry, providing editions for all
Europe, it should turn all intellectual life for generations into vain
controversy. The struggle between reform and popery was followed by the
struggle between Calvinism and Arminianism; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb462" href="#pb462" name="pb462">462</a>]</span>the
second was no less bitter if less bloody than the first,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e25097src" href="#xd25e25097" name=
"xd25e25097src">108</a> the religious strife passing into civil
feud.</p>
<p>The secret of the special bitterness of Calvinist resentment towards
the school of Arminius lay in the fact that the latter endorsed some of
the most galling of the Catholic criticisms of Calvinism. <span class=
"sc">Arminius</span> [Latinized name of Jacob Harmensen or van Harmin,
1560&ndash;1609, professor of theology at Leyden] was personally a man
of great amiability, averse to controversy, but unable to reconcile the
Calvinist view of predestination with his own quasi-rational ethic, and
concerned to secure that the dogma should not be fastened upon all
Dutch Protestants. In his opinion, no effective answer could be made on
Calvinist lines to the argument of Cardinal Bellarmin<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e25108src" href="#xd25e25108" name="xd25e25108src">109</a> that
from much Calvinist doctrine there flowed the consequences: &ldquo;God
is the author of sin; God really sins; God is the only sinner; sin is
no sin at all.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25120src" href=
"#xd25e25120" name="xd25e25120src">110</a> This was substantially true;
and Arminius, like Bellarmin, unable to see that the Calvinist position
was simply a logical reduction to moral absurdity of all theistic
ethic, sought safety in fresh dogmatic modifications. Of these the
Calvinists, in turn, could easily demonstrate the logical incoherence;
and in a ring of dilemmas from which there was no logical exit save
into Naturalism there arose an exacerbated strife, as of men jostling
each other in a prison where some saw their nominal friends in partial
sympathy with their deadly enemies, who jeered at their divisions.</p>
<p>The wonder is that the chaos of dispute and dogmatic tinkering which
followed did not more rapidly disintegrate faith. Calvinists sought
modifications under stress of dialectic, like their predecessors; and
the high &ldquo;Supralapsarian&rdquo; doctrine&mdash;the theory of the
certain regeneration or &ldquo;perseverance&rdquo; of &ldquo;the
saints&rdquo;&mdash;shaded into &ldquo;the Creabilitarian
opinion&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25131src" href="#xd25e25131"
name="xd25e25131src">111</a> and yet another; while the
&ldquo;Sublapsarian&rdquo; view claimed also to safeguard
predestination. So long as men remained in the primary Protestant
temper, convinced that they possessed in their Bibles an infallible
revelation, such strife could but generate new passion, even as it had
done on the other irrational problem of the eucharist. For men of sane
and peaceful disposition, the only modes of peace were resignation and
doubt; and in the case of the doubters the first intellectual movements
would be either <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463"
name="pb463">463</a>]</span>back towards Rome<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25141src" href="#xd25e25141" name="xd25e25141src">112</a> or
further on towards deism. The former course would be taken by some who
had winced under the jeers of the Catholics; the latter by the hardier
spirits who judged Catholicism for themselves. As most of the fighting
had been primed by and transacted over texts, the surrender of the
belief in an inspired scripture greatly reduced the friction; and in
Holland as elsewhere deism would be thus spontaneously generated in the
Protestant atmosphere. A few went even further. &ldquo;I have no doubt
that many persons have secretly revolted from the Reformed Church to
the Papists,&rdquo; wrote Uitenbogaert to Vorstius in 1613. &ldquo;I
firmly believe,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that Atheism is creeping by
degrees into the minds of some.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25149src" href="#xd25e25149" name="xd25e25149src">113</a></p>
<p>Where mere Arminianism could bring Barneveldt to the block, even
deism could not be avowed; and generations had to pass before it could
have the semblance of a party; but the proof of the new vogue of
unbelief lies in the labour spent by Grotius (Hugo or Huig van Groot,
1583&ndash;1645) on his treatise <i lang="la">De Veritate Religionis
Christian&aelig;</i> (1627)&mdash;a learned and strenuous defence of
the faith which had so lacerated his fatherland, first through the long
struggle with Spain, and again in the feud of Arminians and Calvinists.
When Barneveldt was put to death, Grotius had been sentenced to
imprisonment for life; and it was only after three years of the dungeon
that, by the famous stratagem of his wife, he escaped in 1621. The fact
that he devoted his freedom in France first to his great treatise <i>On
the Law of War and Peace</i> (1625), seeking to humanize the civil life
of the world, and next to his defence of the Christian religion, is the
proof of his magnanimity; but the spectacle of his life must have done
as much to set thinkers against the whole creed as his apologetic did
to reconcile them to it. He, the most distinguished Dutch scholar and
the chief apologist of Christianity in his day, had to seek refuge, on
his escape from prison, in Catholic France, whose king granted him a
pension. The circumstance which in Holland chiefly favoured
freethought, the freedom of the press, was, like the great florescence
of the arts in the seventeenth century, a result of the whole social
and political conditions, not of any Protestant belief in free
discussion. That there were freethinkers in Holland in and before
Grotius&rsquo;s time is implied in the pains he took to defend
Christianity; but that they existed in despite and not by grace of the
ruling Protestantism is proved by the fact that they did not venture to
publish their opinions. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb464" href=
"#pb464" name="pb464">464</a>]</span>France, doubtless, he found as
much unbelief as he had left behind. In the end, Grotius and Casaubon
alike recoiled from the narrow Protestantism around them, which had so
sadly failed to realize their hopes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25165src" href="#xd25e25165" name="xd25e25165src">114</a>
&ldquo;In 1642 Grotius had become wholly averse to the Reformation. He
thought it had done more harm than good&rdquo;; and had he lived a few
years longer he would probably have become a Catholic.<a class=

<h3 class="main">&sect; 4. <i>Conclusion</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus concerning the Reformation generally &ldquo;we
are obliged to confess that, especially in Germany, it soon parted
company with free learning; that it turned its back upon culture; that
it lost itself in a maze of arid theological controversy; that it held
out no hand of welcome to awakening science. Presently we shall see
that the impulse to an enlightened study and criticism of the
Scriptures came chiefly from heretical quarters; that the unbelieving
Spinoza and the Arminian Le Clerc pointed the way to investigations
which the great Protestant systematizers thought neither necessary nor
useful. Even at a later time it has been the divines who have most
loudly declared their allegiance to the theology of the Reformation who
have also looked most askance at science, and claimed for their
statements an entire independence of modern knowledge.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e25184src" href="#xd25e25184" name=
"xd25e25184src">116</a> In fine, &ldquo;to look at the Reformation by
itself, to judge it only by its theological and ecclesiastical
development, is to pronounce it a failure&rdquo;; and the claim that
&ldquo;to consider it as part of a general movement of European thought
&hellip; is at once to vindicate its past and to promise it the
future&rdquo;&mdash;this amounts merely to avowing the same thing. Only
as an eddy in the movement of freethought is the Reformation
intellectually significant. Politically it is a great illustration of
the potency of economic forces.</p>
<p>While, however, the Reformation in itself thus did little for the
spirit of freethought, substituting as it did the arbitrary standard of
&ldquo;revelation&rdquo; for the not more arbitrary standard of papal
authority, it set up outside its own sphere some new movements of
rational doubt which must have counted for much in the succeeding
period. It was not merely that, as we shall see, the bloody strifes of
the two Churches, and the quarrels of the Protestant sects among
themselves, sickened many thoughtful men of the whole subject of
theology; but that the disputes between Romanists and anti-Romanists
raised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href="#pb465" name=
"pb465">465</a>]</span>difficult questions as to the bases of all kinds
of belief. As always happens when established beliefs are long
attacked, the subtler spirits in the conservative interest after a time
begin putting in doubt beliefs of every species; a method often
successful with those who cannot carry an argument to its logical
conclusions, and who are thus led to seek harbour in whatever credence
is on the whole most convenient; but one which puts stronger spirits on
the reconsideration of all their opinions. Thus we shall find, not only
in the skepticism of Montaigne, which is historically a product of the
wars of religion in France, but in the more systematic and more
cautious argumentation of the abler Protestants of the seventeenth
century, a measure of general rationalism much more favourable alike to
natural science and to Biblical and ethical criticism than had been the
older environment of authority and tradition, brutal sacerdotalism, and
idolatrous faith. Men continued to hate each other religiously for
trifles, to quarrel over gestures and vestures, and to wrangle
endlessly over worn-out dogmas; but withal new and vital heresies were
set on foot; new science generated new doubt; and under the shadow of
the aging tree of theology there began to appear the growths of a new
era. As Protestantism had come outside the &ldquo;universal&rdquo;
Church, rearing its own tabernacles, so freethought came outside both,
scanning with a deepened intentness the universe of things. And thus
began a more vital innovation than that dividing the Reformation from
the Renaissance, or even that dividing the Renaissance from the Middle
Ages. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb466" href="#pb466" name=

Ranke (p. 466) becomes positively lyrical over the happy lot of the
peasant who received Luther&rsquo;s Catechism (1529). &ldquo;It
contains enduring comfort in every affliction, and, under a slight
husk, the kernel of truths able to satisfy the wisest of the
wise.&rdquo; Such declamation holds the place that ought to have been
filled by an account of economic conditions.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

fragment can hardly have been the <i lang="la">De Tribus

to Mohammed in his fragment, whereas the title of the other book
proceeded on the specification of Mohammed as well as Jesus and Moses.
The existing treatise of that name, in any case, is of later date. Of
the famous treatise in question, which was not published till long
afterwards, Henry admits that it &ldquo;professes to show tranquilly,
and with regret, but without abuse,&rdquo; the fraudulent character of
the three revealed religions. Concerning Gruet&rsquo;s essay he asks:
&ldquo;What are all the anti-Christian writings of the French

Bishop Burnet (<i>Exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles</i>, Art. 18)
has given currency to the pretence that the words &ldquo;saved by the

was no such thought on the part of the framers of the Article is shown
by the Latin version, where the expression is precisely &ldquo;<i>in

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The negative bearing of the Reformation on freethought
is made clear by the historic fact that the new currents of thought
which broadly mark the beginning of the &ldquo;modern spirit&rdquo;
arose in its despite, and derive originally from outside its sphere. It
is to Italy, where the political and social conditions thus far tended
to frustrate the Inquisition, that we trace the rise alike of modern
deism, modern Unitarianism, modern pantheism, modern physics, and the
tendency to rational atheism. The deistic way of thinking, of course,
prevailed long before it got that name; and besides the vogue of
Averro&iuml;sm we have noted the virtual deism of More&rsquo;s
<i>Utopia</i> (1516). The first explicit mention of deism noted by
Bayle, however, is in the epistle dedicatory to the second and expanded
edition of the <i lang="fr">Instruction Chr&eacute;tienne</i> of the
Swiss Protestant Viret (1563), where professed deists are spoken of as
a new species bearing a new name. On the admission of Viret, who was
the friend and bitter disciple of Calvin, they rejected all revealed
religion, but called themselves deists by way of repudiating atheism;
some keeping a belief in immortality, some rejecting it. In the
theological manner he goes on to call them all execrable atheists, and
to say that he has added to his treatise on their account an exposition
of natural religion grounded on the &ldquo;Book of Nature&rdquo;;
stultifying himself by going on to say that he has also dealt with the
professed atheists.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25212src" href=
"#xd25e25212" name="xd25e25212src">1</a> Of the deists he admits that
among them were men of the highest repute for science and learning.
Thus within ten years of the burning of Servetus we find privately
avowed deism and atheism in the area of French-speaking
Protestantism.</p>
<p>Doubtless the spectacle of Protestant feuds and methods would go far
to foster such unbelief; but though, as we have seen, there were
aggressive Unitarians in Germany before 1530, who, being scholars, may
or may not have drawn on Italian thought, thereafter there is reason to
look to Italy as the source of the propaganda. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb467" href="#pb467" name=
"pb467">467</a>]</span>Thence came the two Sozzini, the founders of
Socinianism, of whom Lelio, the uncle of Fausto, travelled much in
northern Europe (including England) between 1546 and 1552.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e25225src" href="#xd25e25225" name=
"xd25e25225src">2</a> As the earlier doctrine of Servetus shows clear
affinities to that of the Sozzini, and his earlier books were much read
in Italy between 1532 and 1540, he may well have given them their
impulse.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25234src" href="#xd25e25234" name=
"xd25e25234src">3</a> It is evidently to Servetus that Zanchi referred
when he wrote to Bullinger in 1565 that &ldquo;Spain bore the hens,
Italy hatched the eggs, and we now hear the chickens
piping.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25248src" href="#xd25e25248"
name="xd25e25248src">4</a> Before Socinianism had taken form it was led
up to, as we have seen, in the later writings of the ex-monk Bernardino
Ochino (1487&ndash;1564), who, in the closing years of a much chequered
career, combined mystical and Unitarian tendencies with a leaning to

so Lord Burghley in his <i>Advice to his Son</i> writes: &ldquo;Suffer
not thy sons to pass the Alps, for they shall learn nothing there but
pride, blasphemy, and atheism.&rdquo; As it happened, his grandson the
second Earl of Exeter, and his great-grandson Lord Roos, went to Rome,
and became not atheists but Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>Such episodes should remind us that in that age of ignorance and
superstition the Church had always an immense advantage. Those who,
like Gentillet in his raging <i lang="fr">Discours</i>, commonly known
as the <i lang="fr">Contre-Machiavel</i> (1576), ascribed to
&ldquo;atheism&rdquo; and the teaching of Machiavelli all the crimes
and oppressions wrought by Catholics,<a class="noteref" id=

ludicrously perverting the facts. Massacres in churches, which are
cited by Gentillet as impossible to believing Catholics, were wrought,
as we have seen, on the largest scale by the Church in the thirteenth
century. So, when Scaliger calls the Italians of his day &ldquo;a set
of atheists,&rdquo; we are to understand it rather of &ldquo;the
hypocrisy than of the professed skepticism of the time.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>Like the old Averro&iuml;sm, the new pietistic Unitarianism
persisted in Italy and radiated thence afresh when it had flagged in
other lands. The exploded Unitarian tradition<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25341src" href="#xd25e25341" name="xd25e25341src">13</a> runs
that the doctrine arose in the year 1546 among a group of more than
forty learned men who were wont to assemble in secret at Vicenza, near
Venice. Claudius of Savoy, however, emphatically gave out his
anti-Trinitarian doctrine at Berne in 1534, after having been
imprisoned at Strasburg and banished thence;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25347src" href="#xd25e25347" name="xd25e25347src">14</a> and
Ochino and Lelio Sozzini left Italy in 1543. But there seems to have
been a continuous evolution of Unitarian heresy in the south after the
German movement had ceased. Giorgio Biandrata, whom we have seen flying
to Poland from Geneva, had been seized by the Inquisition at Pavia for
such opinion. Still it persisted. In 1562 Giulio Guirlando of Treviso,
and in 1566 Francesco Saga of Rovigo, were burned at Venice for
anti-Trinitarianism. Giacomo Aconzio too, who dedicated his
<i>Stratagems of Satan</i> (Basel, 1565) to Queen Elizabeth, and who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=

<p>It is remarkable that the whole ferment occurs in the period of the
Catholic Reaction, the Council of Trent, and the subjection of Italy,
when the papacy was making its great effort to recover its ground. It
would seem that in the compulsory peace which had now fallen on Italian
life men&rsquo;s thoughts turned more than ever to mental problems, as
had happened in Greece after the rise of Alexander&rsquo;s empire. The
authority of the Church was outwardly supreme; the Jesuits had already
begun to do great things for education;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25382src" href="#xd25e25382" name="xd25e25382src">17</a> the
revived Inquisition was everywhere in Italy; its prisons, as we have
seen, were crowded with victims of all grades during a whole
generation; Pius V and the hierarchy everywhere sought to enforce
decorum in life; the &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; academies formed on the
Florentine model were dissolved; and classic culture rapidly decayed
with the arts, while clerical learning flourished,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e25391src" href="#xd25e25391" name="xd25e25391src">18</a> and a
new religious music began with Palestrina. Yet on the death of Paul IV
the Roman populace burned the Office of the Inquisition to the ground
and cast the pope&rsquo;s statue into the Tiber;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25400src" href="#xd25e25400" name="xd25e25400src">19</a> and in
that age (1548) was born Giordano Bruno, one of the types of modern
freethought.</p>
<p>The great service of Italy to modern freethought, however, was to
come later, in respect of the impulse given to the scientific spirit by
Bruno, Vanini, and Galileo. On the philosophical or critical side, the
Italy of the middle of the sixteenth century left no enduring mark on
European thought, though her serious writers were numerous. Aconzio had
published, before his <i lang="la">De Stratagematibus Satan&aelig;</i>,
a treatise <i lang="la">De Methodo, sive recta investigandarum
tradendarumque scientiarum ratione</i> (Basel, 1558), wherein he pleads
strenuously for a true logical method as the one way to real knowledge
of things. In this he anticipates Bacon, as did, still earlier, Mario
Nizolio in his <i lang="la">Antibarbarus sive de veris principiis et
vera ratione philosophandi contra pseudo-philosophos</i> (Parma, 1553).
Nizolio&rsquo;s main effort is towards the discrediting of Aristotle,
whom, like so many in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href=
"#pb470" name="pb470">470</a>]</span>generation following, he regarded
as the great bulwark of scholastic obscurantism. He insists that all
knowledge must proceed from sensation, which alone has immediate
certainty; and thus stands for direct scientific observation as against
tradition and verbalism. But Ludovicus Vives had before him (in his
<i lang="la">De causis corruptarum artium</i>, Antwerp, 1531) claimed
that the true Aristotelian went direct to nature, as Aristotle himself
had done; and Nizolio did nothing in practical science to substantiate
his polemic against the logic-choppers.</p>
<p>He and Aconzio in effect cancel each other. Each had glimpsed a
truth, one seeing the need for a right method in inference, the other
protesting against the idea that abstract reasoning could lead to
knowledge; but neither made good his argument by any treasure trove of
fact. Another writer of the same decade, Gomez Pereira, joined in the
revolt against Aristotelianism, publishing in 1554 his <i lang=
"la">Margarita Antoniana</i>, wherein, in advance of Descartes, he
maintained the absence of sensation in brutes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25430src" href="#xd25e25430" name="xd25e25430src">20</a> For the
rest, he championed freedom in speculation, denying that authority
should avail save in matters of faith. But he too failed to bring forth
fruits meet for freedom. Neither by abstract exposition of right
methods of reasoning, nor by abstract attacks on wrong methods, could
any vital impulse yet be given to thought. What was lacking was the use
of reason upon actual problems, whether of human or of natural science.
All the while Europe was anchored to ancient delusion, historical and
scientific. Even as the horrors of age-long religious war could alone
drive men to something like toleration in the religious life, there was
needed the impact of actual discovery to win them to science as against
scholasticism. And rational thinking on the religion which resisted all
new science was to be still later of attainment, save for the nameless
men who throughout the ages of faith rejected the creeds without
publishing their unbelief. Of these Italy had always a large
sprinkling.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The fact that sixteenth-century Spain could be
charged, on the score of Servetus, with producing the &ldquo;hen&rdquo;
of Socinianism, is an important reminder of the perpetuity of variation
and of the fatality of environment. The Portuguese Sanchez, whom we
shall find laying new potential foundations of skepticism in France
alongside of Montaigne, could neither have acquired nor propounded his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name=
"pb471">471</a>]</span>philosophy in his native land. But it is to be
noted that an elder contemporary of Sanchez, living and dying in Spain,
was able, in the generation after Servetus, to make a real contribution
to the revival of freethought, albeit under shelter of a firm
profession of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>No book of the kind, perhaps, had a wider European popularity than
the <i lang="es">Examen de Ingenios para las ciencias</i> of
<span class="sc">Huarte</span> de San Juan, otherwise Juan Huarte y
Navarro (c. 1530&ndash;1592). Like Servetus and Sanchez and many
another, Huarte had his bias to reason fostered by a medical training;
and it is as a &ldquo;natural philosopher&rdquo; that he stands for a
rational study of causation. As a pioneer of exact science, indeed, he
counts for next to nothing. Taking as his special theme the divergences
of human faculty, he does but found himself on the &agrave; priori
system of &ldquo;humours&rdquo; and &ldquo;temperatures&rdquo; passed
on by Aristotle to Galen and Hippocrates, inconsistently affirming on
the one hand that the &ldquo;characters&rdquo; not only of whole
nations but of the inhabitants of provinces are determined by their
special climates and aliments, and on the other hand that individual
faculty is determined by the proportions of hot and cold, moist and dry
&ldquo;temperatures&rdquo; in the parents. Apart from his insistence on
the functions of the brain, and from broadly rational deliverances as
to the kinds of faculty which determine success in theology and law,
arms and arts, his &ldquo;science&rdquo; is naught. Dealing with an
obscure problem, he brought to it none of the exact inductiveness which
alone had yielded true knowledge in the simpler field of astronomy. In
virtue, however, either of his confidence in affirmation or of his
stand for rational inquiry, or of both, Huarte&rsquo;s book, published
in 1575, went the round of Europe. Translated into Italian in 1582 (or
earlier; new rendering 1600), it was thence rendered into English by
Richard Carew in 1594.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25450src" href=
"#xd25e25450" name="xd25e25450src">21</a> A French version appeared in
1598, and two others in 1661 and 1671. A later English translation,
from the original, was produced in 1698; and Lessing thought the book
worth putting into German in 1785.</p>
<p>The rationalistic importance of Huarte lies in his insistence on the
study of &ldquo;second causes&rdquo; and his protest against the
burking of all inquiry by a reference to deity. On this head he
anticipates much of the polemic of Bacon. The explanation of all
processes and phenomena by the will of God, he observes, &ldquo;is so
ancient a manner of talk, and the natural philosophers have so often
refuted it, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472"
name="pb472">472</a>]</span>the seeking to take the same away were
superfluous, neither is it convenient&#8202;&hellip;. But I have often
gone about to consider the reason and the cause whence it may grow that
the vulgar sort is so great friend to impute all things to God, and to
reave them from Nature, and do so abhor the natural
means.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25463src" href="#xd25e25463"
name="xd25e25463src">22</a> His solution is the impatience of men over
the complexity of Nature, their spiritual arrogance, their indolence,
and their piety. For himself, he pronounces, as Middleton did in
England nearly two centuries later, that &ldquo;God doth no longer
those unwonted things of the New Testament; and the reason is, for that
on his behalf he hath performed all necessary diligence that men might
not pretend ignorance. And to think that he will begin anew to do the
like miracles &hellip; is an error very great&#8202;&hellip;. God
speaks once (saith <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2033:14&amp;version=NRSV">
Job</a>) and turns not to a second replial.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e25469src" href="#xd25e25469" name="xd25e25469src">23</a></p>
<p>Only thus could the principle of natural causation be affirmed in
the Spain of Philip II. Huarte is careful to affirm miracles while
denying their recurrence; and throughout he writes as a good
Scripturist and Catholic. But he sticks to his naturalist thesis that
&ldquo;Nature makes able,&rdquo; and avows that &ldquo;natural
philosophers laugh at such as say, This is God&rsquo;s doing, without
assigning the order and discourse of the particular causes whence they
may spring.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25476src" href=
"#xd25e25476" name="xd25e25476src">24</a> The fact that the book was
dedicated to Philip tells of royal protection, without which the author
could hardly have escaped the Inquisition. Years after, we shall find
Lilly in England protesting on the stage against the conception of
<i lang="la">Natura naturans</i>; and Bacon powerfully reaffirming
Huarte&rsquo;s doctrine, with the same reservations. The Spaniard must
have counted for something as a pleader for elementary reason, if Bacon
did.</p>
<p>But this is practically the only important contribution from Spain
to the intellectual renascence then going on in Europe. As we have
seen, it was not that Spaniards had any primordial bias to dogmatism
and persecution: it was simply that their whole socio-political
evolution, largely determined by Spanish discovery and dominion in the
New World, set up institutions and forces which became specially
powerful to stamp out freethought. The work of progress was done in
lands where lack of external dominion left on the one hand a greater
fund of variant energy, and on the other made for a lesser power of
repression on the part of Church and State. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While Italy continues to be reputed throughout the
sixteenth century a hotbed of freethinking, styled
&ldquo;atheism,&rdquo; it appears to have been in France, alongside of
the wars of religion, that positive unbelief, as distinct from
scripturalist Unitarianism, made most new headway among laymen. It was
in France that the forces of change had greatest play. The mere contact
with Italy which began with the invasion of Charles VII in 1494 meant a
manifold moral and mental influence, affecting French literature and
life alike; and the age of strife and destruction which set in with the
first Huguenot wars could not but be one of disillusionment for
multitudes of serious men. We have seen as much in the work of
Bonaventure des Periers and Rabelais; but the spread of radical
unbelief is to be traced, as is usual in the ages of faith, by the
books written against it. Already in 1552 we have seen Guillaume
Postell publishing his book, <i lang="la">Contra Atheos</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e25498src" href="#xd25e25498" name=
"xd25e25498src">25</a> Unbelief increasing, there is published in 1564
an <i lang="fr">Atheomachie</i> by one De Bourgeville; but the Massacre
must have gone far to frustrate him. In 1581 appears another <i lang=

"xd25e25522src" href="#xd25e25522" name="xd25e25522src">26</a> In both
the Epistle Dedicatory (to Henry of Navarre) and the Preface the author
speaks of the great multiplication of unbelief, the refutation of which
he declares to be more needful among Christians than it ever had been
among the heathen. But, like most of the writers against atheism in
that age, he declares<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25525src" href=
"#xd25e25525" name="xd25e25525src">27</a> that there are no atheists
save a few young fools and utterly bad men, who turn to God as soon as
they fall sick. The reputed atheists of antiquity are vindicated as
having denied not the principle of deity but the false Gods of their
age&mdash;this after the universality of a belief in Gods in all ages
had been cited as one of the primary proofs of God&rsquo;s existence.
In this fashion is compiled a book of nine hundred pages, ostensibly
for the confutation of a few fools and knaves, described as unworthy of
serious consideration. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href=
"#pb474" name="pb474">474</a>]</span>Evidently the unbelief of de
Mornay&rsquo;s day was a more vigorous growth than he affected to
think; and his voluminous performance was followed by others. In 1586,
Christophe Cheffontaines published his <i lang="la">Epitome nov&aelig;
illustrationis Christianae Fidei adversus Impios, Libertinos et
Atheos</i>; and still skepticism gained ground, having found new
abettors.</p>
<p>First came the Portuguese Francisco Sanchez (1552&ndash;1623?), born
in Portugal, but brought as a child to Bordeaux, which seems to have
been a place of refuge for many fugitive heretics from both sides of
the Peninsula. Sanchez has recorded that in his early youth he had no
bias to incredulity of any kind; but at some stage of his adolescence
he travelled in Italy and spent some time at Rome. The result was not
that special disbelief in Christianity which was proverbially apt to
follow, but a development on his part of philosophic skepticism
properly so-called, which found expression in a Latin treatise entitled
<i lang="la">Quod Nihil Scitur</i>&mdash;&ldquo;That Nothing is
Known.&rdquo; Composed as early as 1576, in the author&rsquo;s
twenty-fourth year, the book was not published till 1581, a year after
the first issue of the <i>Essais</i> of Montaigne. It is natural to
surmise that while Sanchez was at Bordeaux he may have known something
of his famous contemporary; but though Montaigne is likely to have read
the <i lang="la">Quod Nihil Scitur</i> in due course, he nowhere speaks
of it; and in 1576 Sanchez was a Professor of Medicine at Montpellier,
then a town of Huguenot leanings. Soon he left it for Toulouse, the
hotbed of Catholic fanaticism, where he contrived to live out his long
life in peace, despite his production of a Pyrrhonist treatise and of a
remarkable Latin poem (1578) on the comet of 1577. The <i lang=
"la">Quod Nihil Scitur</i> is a skeptical flank attack on current
science, in no way animadverting on religion, as to which he professed
orthodoxy: the poem is a frontal attack on the whole creed of
astrology, then commonly held by Averro&iuml;sts and Aristotelians, as
well as by orthodox Catholics. Yet he seems never to have been
molested. It would seem as if a skepticism which ostensibly disallowed
all claims to &ldquo;natural&rdquo; knowledge, while avowedly
recognizing &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; was then as later thought to make
rather for faith than against it. That such virtual Pyrrhonism as that
of Sanchez can ever have ministered to religious zeal is not indeed to
be supposed: it is rather as a weapon against the confidence of the
&ldquo;Naturalist&rdquo; that the skeptical method has always
recommended itself to the calculating priest. And inasmuch as astrology
could be, and was, held by a non-religious theory, though many
Christians added it to their creed, a polemic against that was the
least dangerous form of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href=
"#pb475" name="pb475">475</a>]</span>rationalizing then possible. At
all times there had been priests who so reasoned, though, as we have
seen in dealing with the men of the Protestant Reformation, the belief
in astral influences is too closely akin to the main line of religious
tradition to be capable of ejection on religious grounds.</p>
<p>With his hostility to credulous hopes and fears in the sphere of
Nature, Sanchez is naturally regarded as a forerunner and helper of
freethought. But there is nothing to show that his work had any effect
in undermining the most formidable of all the false beliefs of
Christendom.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25551src" href="#xd25e25551"
name="xd25e25551src">28</a> Like so many others of his age, he flouted
Aristotelean scholasticism, but was perforce silent as to the
verbalisms and sophistries of simple theology. It may fairly be
inferred that his poem on the comet of 1577 helped to create that
current of reasoned disbelief<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25557src"
href="#xd25e25557" name="xd25e25557src">29</a> which we find throwing
up almost identical expressions in Montaigne, Shakespeare, and
Moli&egrave;re,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25566src" href="#xd25e25566"
name="xd25e25566src">30</a> concerning the folly of connecting the
stars with human affairs. But a skepticism which left untouched the
main matter of the creeds could not affect conduct in general; and
while Sanchez passed unchecked the watchdogs of the Inquisition, the
fiery Bruno and Vanini were in his day to meet their fiery death at its
hands&mdash;the latter in Toulouse, perhaps under the eyes of Sanchez.
Having resigned his professorship of medicine, he seems to have lived
to a ripe age, dying in 1623.</p>
<p>Probably those very deaths availed more for the rousing of critical
thought than did the dialectic of the Pyrrhonist. To the life of the
reason may with perfect accuracy be applied the claim so often made for
that of religion&mdash;that it feeds on feeling and is rooted in
experience. Revolt from the cruelties and follies of faith plays a
great part in the history of freethought. In the greatest French writer
of that age, a professed Catholic, but in mature life averse alike to
Catholic and to Protestant bigotry, the shock of the Massacre of Saint
Bartholomew can be seen disintegrating once for all the spirit of
faith. <span class="sc">Montaigne</span> typifies the kind of
skepticism produced in an unscientific age by the practical
demonstration that religion can avail immeasurably more for evil than
for good.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25588src" href="#xd25e25588" name=

old <i lang="la">Theologia Naturalis</i> of Raymond of Sebonde; and we
know from the later <i>Apology</i> in the Essays that freethinking
contemporaries declared the argument of Raymond to be wholly
insufficient.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25617src" href="#xd25e25617"
name="xd25e25617src">33</a> It is clear from the same essay that
Montaigne felt as much; though the gist of his polemic is a vehement
attack upon all forms of confident opinion, religious and
anti-religious alike. &ldquo;In replying to arguments of so opposite a
tenour, Montaigne leaves Christianity, as well as Raimond Sebonde,
without a leg to stand upon. He demolishes the arguments of Sebonde
with the rest of human presumption, and allows Christianity, neither
held by faith nor provable by reason, to fall between the two
stools.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25620src" href="#xd25e25620"
name="xd25e25620src">34</a> The truth is that Montaigne&rsquo;s
skepticism was the product of a mental evolution spread over at least
twenty years. In his youth his vivid temperament kept him both
credulous and fanatical, so much so that in 1562 he took the reckless
oath prescribed by the Catholic Parlement of Paris. As he avows with
his incomparable candour, he had been in many things peculiarly
susceptible to outside influences, being always ready to respond to the
latest pressure;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25626src" href=
"#xd25e25626" name="xd25e25626src">35</a> and the knowledge of his
susceptibility made him self-distrustful. But gradually he found
himself. Beginning to recoil from the ferocities and iniquities of the
League, he yet remained for a time hotly anti-Protestant; and it seems
to have been his dislike of Protestant criticism that led him to run
amuck against reason, at the cost of overthrowing the treatise he had
set out to defend. The common end of such petulant skepticism is a
plunge into uneasy yet unreasoning faith; but, though Montaigne

<p>That philosophy was not, indeed, an original construction: he found
it to his hand partly in the deism of his favourite Seneca; partly in
the stoical ethic of Epictetus, then so much appreciated in France; and
partly in the <i>Hypotyposes</i> of Sextus Empiricus, of which the
Latin translation is known to have been among his <span class=

href="#xd25e25660" name="xd25e25660src">39</a> and from which he
frequently quotes towards the end of his <i>Apology</i>. The body of
ideas compacted on these bases cannot be called a system: it was not in
Montaigne&rsquo;s nature to frame a logical scheme of thought; and he
was far from being the philosophic skeptic he set out to be<a class=

"xd25e25669src">40</a> by way of confounding at once the bigots and the

freely admitted. As he put it in a passage added to the later editions

<blockquote>
<p class="first">His conformities, verbal and practical, have set
certain Catholics upon proving his orthodoxy, though his Essays are
actually prohibited by the Church. A Benedictine, Dom Devienne,
published in 1773 a <i lang="fr">Dissertation sur la Religion de
Montaigne</i>, of which the main pleas are that the <i>Essais</i> often
affirm the divinity of the Christian faith; that the essayist received
the freedom of the city of Rome under the eyes of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name=
"pb478">478</a>]</span>pope; and that his epitaph declared his
orthodoxy! A generation later, one Labouderie undertook to set forth
<i lang="fr">Le Christianisme de Montaigne</i> in a volume of 600 pages
(1819). This apologist has the courage to face the protest of Pascal:
&ldquo;Montaigne puts everything in a doubt so universal and so general
that, doubting even whether he doubts, his uncertainty turns upon
itself in a perpetual and unresting circle&#8202;&hellip;. It is in
this doubt which doubts of itself, and in this ignorance which is
ignorant of itself, that the essence of his opinion
consists&#8202;&hellip;. In a word, he is a pure Pyrrhonist&rdquo;
(<i lang="fr">Pens&eacute;es</i>, supp. to Pt. i, art. 11). The reply
of the apologist is that Montaigne never extends his skepticism to
&ldquo;revelation,&rdquo; but on the contrary declares that revelation
alone gives man certainties (work cited, p. 127).</p>
<p>That is of course merely the device of a hundred skeptics of the
Middle Ages; the old shibboleth of a &ldquo;twofold truth&rdquo;
modified by a special disparagement of reason, with no attempt to meet
the rejoinder that, if reason has no certainties, there can be no
certainty that revelation is what it claims to be. When the apologist
concludes that Montaigne&rsquo;s aim <i lang="fr">en froissant la
raison humaine</i> is to &ldquo;oblige men to recognize the need of a
revelation to fix his incertitudes,&rdquo; it suffices to answer that
Montaigne in so many words declares at the outset of the <i lang=
"fr">Apologie de Raimond Sebonde</i> that he knows nothing of theology,
which is equivalent to saying that he is not a student of the Bible. As
a matter of fact he never quotes it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the last and most characteristic essay of all, discoursing at
large <i>Of Experience</i>, he makes the most daring attack on laws in
general, as being always arbitrary and often irrational, and not seldom
more criminal than the offences they punish. After a planless discourse
of diseases and diets, follies of habit and follies of caprice, the
wisdom of self-rule and the wisdom of irregularity, he contrives to
conclude at once that we should make the best of everything and that
&ldquo;only authority is of force with men of common reach and
understanding, and is of more weight in a strange
language&rdquo;&mdash;a plea for Catholic ritual. Yet in the same page
he pronounces that &ldquo;Supercelestial opinions and under-terrestrial
manners are things that amongst us I have ever seen to be of singular
accord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no final recognition here of religion as even a useful
factor in life. In point of fact Montaigne&rsquo;s whole habit of mind
is perfectly fatal to orthodox religion; and it is clear that, despite
his professions of conformity, he did not hold the Christian
beliefs.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25755src" href="#xd25e25755" name=
"xd25e25755src">48</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href=
"#pb479" name="pb479">479</a>]</span>He was simply a deist. Again and
again he points to Sokrates as the noblest and wisest of men; there is
no reference to Jesus or any of the saints. Whatever he might say in
the <i>Apology</i>, in the other essays he repeatedly reveals a radical
unbelief. The essay on Custom strikes at the root of all orthodoxy,
with its thrusts at &ldquo;the gross imposture of religions, wherewith
so many worthy and sufficient men have been besotted and
drunken,&rdquo; and its terse avowal that &ldquo;miracles are according
to the ignorance wherein we are by nature, and not according to
nature&rsquo;s essence.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25769src"
href="#xd25e25769" name="xd25e25769src">49</a> Above all, he rejected
the great superstition of the age, the belief in witchcraft; and,
following the lead of Wier,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25772src" href=
"#xd25e25772" name="xd25e25772src">50</a> suggested a medical view of
the cases of those who professed wizardry.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25776src" href="#xd25e25776" name="xd25e25776src">51</a> This is
the more remarkable because his rubber-ball fashion of following
impulsions and rebounding from certainty made him often disparage other
men&rsquo;s certainties of disbelief just because they were
certainties. Declaring that he prefers above all things qualified and
doubtful propositions,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25779src" href=
"#xd25e25779" name="xd25e25779src">52</a> he makes as many confident
assertions of his own as any man ever did. But the effect of the whole
is a perpetual stimulus to questioning. His function in literature was
thus to set up a certain mental atmosphere,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25782src" href="#xd25e25782" name="xd25e25782src">53</a> and this
the extraordinary vitality of his utterance enabled him to do to an
incalculable extent. He had the gift to disarm or at least to baffle
hostility, to charm kings,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25791src" href=
"#xd25e25791" name="xd25e25791src">54</a> to stand free between warring
factions. No book ever written conveys more fully the sensation of a
living voice; and after three hundred years he has as friendly an
audience as ever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Owen notes (<i>French Skeptics</i>, p. 446; cp.
Champion, pp. 168&ndash;69) that, though the papal curia requested
Montaigne to alter certain passages in the Essays, &ldquo;it cannot be
shown that he erased or modified a single one of the points.&rdquo;
Sainte-Beuve, indeed, has noted many safeguarding clauses added to the
later versions of the essay on Prayers (i, 56): but they really carry
further the process of doubt. M. Champion has well shown how the
profession of personal indecision and mere self-portraiture served as a
passport for utterances which would have brought instant punishment on
an author who showed any clear purpose. As it was, nearly a century
passed before the Essais were placed upon the Roman <i lang="la">Index
Librorum Prohibitorum</i> (1676).</p>
<p>To the orthodox of his own day Montaigne seems to have given entire
satisfaction. Thus Florimond de B&oelig;mond, in his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name=
"pb480">480</a>]</span><i>Antichrist</i> (2e &eacute;d. 1599, p. 4),
begins his apologetic with a skeptical argument, which he winds up by
referring the reader with eulogy to the <i lang="fr">Apologie</i> of
Montaigne. The modern resort to the skeptical method in defence of
traditional faith seems to date from this time. See Prof. Fortunat
Strowski, <i lang="fr">Histoire du sentiment religieux en France au
xviie si&egrave;cle</i>; 1907, i, 55, <i>note</i>. (<i lang="fr">De
Montaigne &agrave; Pascal.</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The momentum of such an influence is seen in the work of
<span class="sc">Charron</span> (1541&ndash;1603), Montaigne&rsquo;s
friend and disciple. The <i>Essais</i> had first appeared in 1580; the
expanded and revised issue in 1588; and in 1601 there appeared
Charron&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">De la Sagesse</i>, which gives methodic
form and as far as was permissible a direct application to
Montaigne&rsquo;s naturalistic principles. Charron&rsquo;s is a curious
case of mental evolution. First a lawyer, then a priest, he became a
highly successful popular preacher and champion of the Catholic League;
and as such was favoured by the notorious Marguerite (the
Second<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25833src" href="#xd25e25833" name=
"xd25e25833src">55</a>) of Navarre. On the assassination of the Duke of
Guise by order of Henri III he delivered an indignant protest from the
pulpit, of which, however, he rapidly repented.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25839src" href="#xd25e25839" name="xd25e25839src">56</a> Becoming
the friend of Montaigne in 1586, he shows already in 1593, in his
<i>Three Truths</i>, the influence of the essayist&rsquo;s
skepticism,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25858src" href="#xd25e25858"
name="xd25e25858src">57</a> though Charron&rsquo;s book was expressly
framed to refute, first, the atheists; second, the pagans, Jews,
Mohammedans; and, third, the Christian heretics and schismatics. The
<i>Wisdom</i>, published only eight years later, is a work of a very
different cast, proving a mental change. Even in the first work
&ldquo;the growing teeth of the skeptic are discernible beneath the
well-worn stumps of the believer&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25867src" href="#xd25e25867" name="xd25e25867src">58</a> but the
second almost testifies to a new birth. Professedly orthodox, it was
yet recognized at once by the devout as a &ldquo;seminary of
impiety,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25870src" href="#xd25e25870"
name="xd25e25870src">59</a> and brought on its author a persecution
that lasted till his sudden death from apoplexy, which his critics
pronounced to be a divine dispensation. In the second and rearranged
edition, published a year after his death, there are some
modifications; but they are so far from essential<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e25876src" href="#xd25e25876" name="xd25e25876src">60</a> that
Buckle found the book as it stands a kind of pioneer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name=

"xd25e25890src" href="#xd25e25890" name="xd25e25890src">61</a> Its way
of putting all religions on one level, as being alike grounded on bad
evidence and held on prejudice, is only the formal statement of an old
idea, found, like so many others of Charron&rsquo;s, in Montaigne; but
the didactic purpose and method turn the skeptic&rsquo;s shrug into a
resolute propaganda. So with the formal and earnest insistence that
true morality cannot be built on religious hopes and fears&mdash;a
principle which Charron was the first to bring directly home to the
modern intelligence,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25893src" href=
"#xd25e25893" name="xd25e25893src">62</a> as he did the principle of
development in religious systems.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25896src"
href="#xd25e25896" name="xd25e25896src">63</a> Attempting as it does to
construct a systematic practical philosophy of life, the book puts
aside so positively the claims of the theologians,<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e25899src" href="#xd25e25899" name="xd25e25899src">64</a> and
so emphatically subordinates religion to the rule of natural
reason,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25906src" href="#xd25e25906" name=
"xd25e25906src">65</a> that it constitutes a virtual revolution in
public doctrine for Christendom. As Montaigne is the effective beginner
of modern literature, so is Charron the beginner of modern secular
teaching. He is a Naturalist, professing theism; and it is not
surprising to find that for a time his book was even more markedly than
Montaigne&rsquo;s the French &ldquo;freethinker&rsquo;s
breviary.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Strowski, as cited, pp. 164&ndash;65, 183 <i>sq.</i>,
founding on Garasse and Mersenne. Strowski at first pronounces Charron
&ldquo;in reality only a collector of commonplaces&rdquo; (p. 166); but
afterwards obliviously confesses (p. 191) that &ldquo;his audacities
are astonishing,&rdquo; and explains that &ldquo;he formulates, perhaps
without knowing it, a whole doctrine of irreligion which outgoes the
man and the time&mdash;a thought stronger than the thinker!&rdquo; And
again he forgetfully speaks of &ldquo;<span lang="fr">cette critique
hardie et m&eacute;thodique, j&rsquo;allais &eacute;crire
scientifique</span>&rdquo; (p. 240). All this would be a new form of
commonplace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was only powerful protection that could save such a book from
proscription; but Charron and his book had the support at once of Henri
IV and the President Jeannin&mdash;the former a proved indifferentist
to religious forms; the latter the author of the remark that a peace
with two religions was better than a war which had none. Such a temper
had become predominant even among professed Catholics, as may he
gathered from the immense popularity of the <i lang="fr">Satyre
Menipp&eacute;e</i> (1594). Ridiculing as it did the insensate
fanaticism of the Catholic League, that composition was naturally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb482" href="#pb482" name=
"pb482">482</a>]</span>described as the work of atheists; but there
seems to have been no such element in the case, the authors being all
Catholics of good standing, and some of them even having a record for
zeal.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25929src" href="#xd25e25929" name=
"xd25e25929src">66</a> The <i lang="fr">Satyre</i> was in fact the
triumphant revolt of the humorous common sense of France against the
tyranny of fanaticism, which it may be said to have overthrown at one
stroke,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25950src" href="#xd25e25950" name=
"xd25e25950src">67</a> inasmuch as it made possible the entry of Henri
into Paris. By a sudden appeal to secular sanity and the sense of
humour it made the bulk of the Catholic mass ashamed of its past
course.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25954src" href="#xd25e25954" name=
"xd25e25954src">68</a> On the other hand, it is expressly testified by
the Catholic historian De Thou that all the rich and the aristocracy
held the League in abomination.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e25963src"
href="#xd25e25963" name="xd25e25963src">69</a> In such an atmosphere
rationalism must needs germinate, especially when the king&rsquo;s
acceptance of Catholicism dramatized the unreality of the grounds of
strife.</p>
<p>After the assassination of the king in 1610, the last of the bloody
deeds which had kept France on the rack of uncertainty in
religion&rsquo;s name for three generations, the spirit of rationalism
naturally did not wane. In the Paris of the early seventeenth century,
doubtless, the new emancipation came to be associated, as
&ldquo;libertinism,&rdquo; with licence as well as with freethinking.
In the nature of the case there could be no serious and free literary
discussion of the new problems either of life or belief, save insofar
as they had been handled by Montaigne and Charron; and, inasmuch as the
accounts preserved of the freethought of the age are almost invariably
those of its worst enemies, it is chiefly their side of the case that
has been presented. Thus in 1623 the Jesuit Father Fran&ccedil;ois
Garasse published a thick quarto of over a thousand pages, entitled
<i lang="fr">La Doctrine Curieuse des Beaux Esprits de ce temps, ou
pr&eacute;tendus tels</i>, in which he assails the
&ldquo;libertins&rdquo; of the day with an infuriated industry. The
eight books into which he divides his treatise proceed upon eight
alleged maxims of the freethinkers, which run as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I. There are very few good wits [<i lang="fr">bons
Esprits</i>] in the world; and the fools, that is to say, the common
run of men, are not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb483" href="#pb483"
name="pb483">483</a>]</span>capable of our doctrine; therefore it will
not do to speak freely, but in secret, and among trusting and
cabalistic souls.</p>
<p>II. Good wits [<i lang="fr">beaux Esprits</i>] believe in God only
by way of form, and as a matter of public policy (<i lang="fr">par
Maxime d&rsquo;Etat</i>).</p>
<p>III. A <i lang="fr">bel Esprit</i> is free in his belief, and is not
readily to be taken in by the quantity of nonsense that is propounded
to the simple populace.</p>
<p>IV. All things are conducted and governed by Destiny, which is
irrevocable, infallible, immovable, necessary, eternal, and inevitable
to all men whomsoever.</p>
<p>V. It is true that the book called the Bible, or the Holy Scripture,
is a good book (<i lang="fr">un gentil livre</i>), and contains a lot
of good things; but that a <i lang="fr">bon esprit</i> should be
obliged to believe under pain of damnation all that is therein, down to
the tail of Tobit&rsquo;s dog, does not follow.</p>
<p>VI. There is no other divinity or sovereign power in the world but
<span class="sc">Nature</span>, which must be satisfied in all things,
without refusing anything to our body or senses that they desire of us
in the exercise of their natural powers and faculties.</p>
<p>VII. Supposing there be a God, as it is decorous to admit, so as not
to be always at odds with the superstitious, it does not follow that
there are creatures which are purely intellectual and separated from
matter. All that is in Nature is composite, and therefore there are
neither angels nor devils in the world, and it is not certain that the
soul of man is immortal.</p>
<p>VIII. It is true that to live happily it is necessary to extinguish
and drown all scruples; but all the same it does not do to appear
impious and abandoned, for fear of offending the simple or losing the
support of the superstitious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously neither candid<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e26021src" href="#xd25e26021" name="xd25e26021src">70</a> nor
competent writing; and as it happens there remains proof, in the case
of the life of La Mothe le Vayer, that &ldquo;earnest freethought in
the beginning of the seventeenth century afforded a <i lang="fr">point
d&rsquo;appui</i> for serious-minded men, which neither the corrupt
Romanism nor the narrow Protestantism of the period could
furnish.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e26042src" href="#xd25e26042"
name="xd25e26042src">71</a> Garasse&rsquo;s own doctrine was that
&ldquo;the true liberty of the mind consists in a simple and docile
(<i lang="fr">sage</i>) belief in all that the Church propounds,
indifferently and without distinction.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e26057src" href="#xd25e26057" name="xd25e26057src">72</a> The
later social history of Catholic France is the sufficient comment on
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name=
"pb484">484</a>]</span>efficacy of such teaching to regulate life. In
any case the new ideas steadily gained ground; and on the heels of the
treatise of Garasse appeared that of Marin Mersenne, <i lang=
"fr">L&rsquo;impiet&eacute; des D&eacute;istes, Ath&eacute;es et
Libertins de ce temps combattue, avec la refutation des opinions de
Charron, de Cardan, de Jordan Brun, et des quatraines du
D&eacute;iste</i> (1624). In a previous treatise, <i lang=
"la">Qu&aelig;stiones celeberrim&aelig; in Genesim &hellip; in quo
volumine Athei et Deisti impugnantur et expugnantur</i> (1623),
Mersenne set agoing the often-quoted assertion that, while atheists
abounded throughout Europe, they were so specially abundant in France
that in Paris alone there were some fifty thousand. Even taking the
term &ldquo;atheist&rdquo; in the loosest sense in which such writers
used it, the statement was never credited by any contemporary, or by
its author; but neither did anyone doubt that there was an
unprecedented amount of unbelief. The <i lang="fr">Quatraines du
D&eacute;iste</i>, otherwise <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Antibigot</i>, was a
poem of one hundred and six stanzas, never printed, but widely
circulated in manuscript in its day. It is poor poetry enough, but its
doctrine of a Lucretian God who left the world to itself sufficed to
create a sensation, and inspired Mersenne to write a poem in
reply.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e26080src" href="#xd25e26080" name=
"xd25e26080src">73</a> Such were the signs of the times when Pascal was
in his cradle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Mersenne&rsquo;s statistical assertion was made in two
sheets of the <i lang="la">Qu&aelig;stiones Celeberrim&aelig;</i>,

(Bouillier, <i lang="fr">Hist. de la philos. cart&eacute;sienne</i>,
1854, i, 28, where the passage is cited). The suppressed sheets
included a list of the &ldquo;atheists&rdquo; of the time, occupying
five folio columns. (Julian Hibbert, <i>Plutarchus and Theophrastus on
Superstition</i>, etc., 1828; App. Catal. of Works written against
Atheism, p. 3; Prosper Marchand, <i lang="fr">Lettre sur le Cymbalum

Prof. Strowski, <i lang="fr">De Montaigne &agrave; Pascal</i>, 1907, p.
138 <i>sq.</i>) Mersenne himself, in the preface to his book,
stultifies his suppressed assertion by declaring that the impious in
Paris boast falsely of their number, which is really small, unless
heretics be reckoned as atheists. Garasse, writing against them, all
the while professed to know only five atheists, three of them Italians
(Strowski, as cited).</p>

(p. 570) comes to this conclusion after carefully collating the
editions. Cp. p. 587, <i>note</i>. The whole of the alterations,
including those proposed by President Jeannin, will be found set forth
in the edition of 1607, and the reprints of that. One of the modified
passages (first ed. p. 257; ed. 1609, p. 785) is the Montaignesque
comment (noted by Prof. Strowski, p. 195) on the fashion in which
men&rsquo;s religion is determined by their place of birth.
